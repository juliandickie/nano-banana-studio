# Nano Banana Studio: Expansion Roadmap

## Context

Nano Banana Studio v3.6.3 is a comprehensive Creative Director plugin for AI image and video generation. This roadmap captures planned features, organized by implementation priority.

**Architecture:** Two interlinked skills sharing brand presets and asset registry:
1. **Image Skill** (`/banana`) — 24 commands: generation, editing, social media, slides, brand guides, assets, analytics, content pipeline
2. **Video Skill** (`/video`) — 10 commands: VEO 3.1 generation, image-to-video, multi-shot sequences with storyboard approval, clip extension, FFmpeg toolkit

## Planned Features

### v3.5.0 — VEO 3.1 Model Variants & Draft Workflow (SHIPPED 2026-04-10)

v3.5.0 shipped the VEO 3.1 model variant work (Standard / Fast / Lite /
Legacy 3.0), corrected pricing, the `--quality-tier` draft-then-final
workflow for sequences, Scene Extension v2 as the default extension
method, token-limit prompt validation, and a full rewrite of
`veo-models.md`. See `CHANGELOG.md` for the full list.

The "Sequence Production Improvements" items below (review gate, plan
hash tracking, audio strategy split, etc.) originally slated for v3.5.0
are **deferred to v3.6.0** — the coffee shop demo surfaced the model
variant gap as a higher-priority blocker, so that work landed first.

### v3.6.0 — Vertex AI Backend (SHIPPED 2026-04-11)

v3.6.0 shipped the Vertex AI backend that v3.5.0's reality check
revealed was needed. The auth approach turned out to be much simpler
than the original plan anticipated: bound-to-service-account API keys
(the `AQ.*` format from Vertex Express Mode signup) work for
`predictLongRunning` even though Google's Express Mode docs only list
3 methods. No OAuth, no service account JSON, no `gcloud` install.

**What shipped:**

- `_vertex_backend.py` helper module (~650 lines, stdlib only) with
  request body builder, URL composer, response parser, and a
  `--diagnose` CLI for free auth verification.
- `--backend {auto,gemini-api,vertex-ai}` flag on `video_generate.py`
  with auto-routing rules: text-only on preview IDs → Gemini API
  (v3.4.x compat), Vertex-only models or any image/video input →
  Vertex AI.
- `vertex_api_key` / `vertex_project_id` / `vertex_location` in
  `~/.banana/config.json`.
- Service-agent provisioning auto-retry (90 s sleep + retry once on
  the transient cold-start error).
- Scene Extension v2 `durationSeconds=7` auto-override.
- `--quality-tier draft` re-pointed from Fast back to Lite (the
  original v3.5.0 promise — 8× cost reduction restored).
- `video_extend.py --method` default flipped back to `video`.
- 1:1 aspect ratio special-case removed (was wrong in v3.5.0 docs).
- Lite duration constraint corrected to {4, 6, 8} (was wrong as 5-60
  in v3.5.0 docs).
- Doc rewrites in `veo-models.md`, `video-sequences.md`, `SKILL.md`,
  `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Carry-over from v3.5.0 plan still deferred to v3.6.1:**

The v3.6.0 implementation focused on the backend unblock; the
sequence-production-improvements scope from the original v3.5.0 plan
(review gate, plan hash tracking, audio strategy split, etc.) is
still pending. These items are documented below as v3.6.1 priorities.

### v3.6.1 — Deferred Sequence Production Improvements

These learnings came from producing the first real 30-second multi-shot sequence (the coffee shop demo for the README). The theoretical pipeline shipped in v3.3.0 works, but these specific gaps surfaced during actual use. They were originally scoped to v3.5.0, deferred to v3.6.0 because the model variant unblock landed first, then deferred again to v3.6.1 because v3.6.0's scope was the Vertex AI backend:

#### Process & UX — Make the approval gate impossible to skip

- **`/video sequence review` subcommand** — Given a plan.json with populated prompts and a storyboard directory, generate a `REVIEW-SHEET.md` that interleaves each shot's frames inline with its VEO prompt, cost estimate, and parameters. This is the artifact I hand-wrote during the demo. The sequence skill should produce it automatically whenever the storyboard changes, so it's always fresh and always current.
- **Default output location should be visible from Finder** — The current `video_sequence.py` writes plans to `/tmp` by default, which is hidden on macOS. Change default to `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences/<project-name>/` so users can review with Quick Look (`Space` key) out of the box. Keep `--output` flag for explicit overrides.
- **Review sheet should be the mandatory gate between `storyboard` and `generate`** — `video_sequence.py generate` should refuse to run if no `REVIEW-SHEET.md` exists for the current plan, or if the plan hash in the review sheet doesn't match the current plan.json hash (detects stale reviews). Override flag `--skip-review` for CI/automation use.
- **Rename the approval gate step explicitly** — Currently steps are `plan → storyboard → generate → stitch`. Rename to `plan → storyboard → review → generate → stitch`, making the human approval a first-class pipeline stage.

#### Plan freshness — Prevent prompt drift from frame updates

- **Plan hash tracking** — When storyboard frames are regenerated, the sequence script should detect that the frames changed and flag the corresponding prompts as potentially stale. One option: store a SHA-256 of each frame in the plan.json, compare on review-sheet generation, and emoji-flag any shot where the frame has changed since the prompt was last edited.
- **`/video sequence update-prompts` subcommand** — Given a plan with regenerated frames, suggest updated prompt wording that references the new frame details. This would use the image-to-text capability of Gemini to describe the current frame, then propose prompt edits that match.
- **Single source of truth** — During the demo, the plan.json said one thing ("overhead shot") while the actual frames showed another ("three-quarter high angle"). The review-sheet generation should actually *read* the frames and compare against prompt claims before presenting for approval.

#### Sequence architecture — Support "end frame optional" shots

- **Flag: `end_frame: null` explicitly means VEO interpolates** — Add a `use_veo_interpolation: true` field to shots in plan.json. When true, only the start frame is used, and the VEO call drops `--last-frame`. This was a real architectural need in Shot 1 of the coffee shop demo: cutting to an unrelated Shot 2 meant we didn't need to constrain where Shot 1 ended, freeing VEO to execute a dramatic push-in.
- **`video_sequence.py storyboard --shots 1,3` partial regeneration** — Add ability to regenerate frames for specific shots without rebuilding the whole storyboard. Critical for iteration when one frame has a bug but others are approved.
- **Store shot types explicitly: `establishing`, `medium`, `closeup`, `product`, `transition`, `cutaway`, `b-roll`** — This field exists in the plan.json schema but has no semantic effect. It should drive defaults like duration, camera style hints, and whether an end frame is recommended.

#### Image-to-image frame chaining — Make it first-class

- **Add `--reference-image` flag to `generate.py`** — Currently the only way to do reference-based generation is to use `edit.py`, which is misleadingly named. Add `--reference-image PATH` to `generate.py` that passes the image as an `inlineData` part alongside the text prompt. This is the same thing `edit.py` does under the hood, but using `generate.py` makes the intent clear: "generate a new image informed by this reference", not "edit this image".
- **Document the conservatism bias** — Image-to-image mode anchors heavily on source geometry and is excellent for continuity (same cup across shots) but bad for large camera moves (dolly from wide to close-up). The prompt engineering reference should document when to use text-only vs image-reference:
  - **Text-only generation** — Large camera moves, dramatic framing changes, establishing → close-up transitions within a shot
  - **Image-reference generation** — Character/object identity locks, cross-shot prop continuity, minor framing adjustments, style matching
- **Output resolution warning** — Image-reference mode returns half-resolution (~1376×768 from a 2K source). For VEO input this is acceptable (above 720p minimum), but the user should know. Add a note to the generate script's output JSON that says `{"source_resolution": "2K", "output_resolution": "1K-ish", "reason": "image-to-image downscaling"}` when applicable.

#### Audio strategy — Decide dialogue and narration up front

The sequence pipeline currently has a single free-text `audio` field per shot that mixes ambient sound, SFX, dialogue, and narration indiscriminately. In practice these are three architecturally different audio modes, and the decision must be made *before* shot prompts are written because it changes the visuals, timing, and duration:

- **Ambient + SFX (VEO generates natively)** — Background atmosphere and action-matched sound effects. VEO handles these well and they don't constrain the visual prompt. This is what the coffee shop demo uses.
- **On-camera dialogue (VEO generates with lip-sync)** — A character speaks visible lines during the shot. VEO supports this in English with strict constraints:
  - 8-second duration limit (dialogue clips can't be extended)
  - Lip-sync is reliable only for short phrases (3-8 words per clip)
  - The speaking character must be visible in the frame
  - The prompt must explicitly include the line in quotation marks
  - Changes the prompt structure: `A woman says, "Welcome to our cafe," as she places a latte on the counter.`
- **Voiceover narration (post-production overlay)** — Narrator speaks over the sequence without appearing on camera. VEO doesn't generate this; it's added in post. But it affects:
  - Total sequence duration (narration paces the cut lengths)
  - Shot pacing (each shot must be long enough for its share of narration)
  - Visual framing (shots can't introduce audio-distracting elements during narration)
  - Cost (no extra VEO cost, but needs text-to-speech or voice actor + audio editing)

**Implementation tasks for v3.5.0:**

- **Add a sequence-level `narration` field to plan.json** — `narration: null` (none), `narration: "text..."` (voiceover text to be added in post), or `narration: "sync"` (on-camera dialogue only, see per-shot `dialogue` field below).
- **Add a per-shot `dialogue` field to plan.json** — separate from the `audio` field. When present, it signals on-camera sync-sound dialogue and triggers VEO prompt construction that includes the line, timing cues, and lip-sync requirements.
- **Split the `audio` field into `ambient` and `sfx`** — two clean fields instead of one blob. VEO prompts should always include both.
- **`/video sequence plan` should ask about audio strategy up front** — before generating shot skeletons, the planning step should prompt Claude (via the SKILL.md instructions) to ask the user: "Does this sequence have voiceover narration? On-camera dialogue? Ambient only?" and record the answer in the plan. This single decision cascades into every shot's prompt.
- **`/video sequence narration` subcommand** — post-generation, given a finished stitched MP4 and a narration script, call a TTS service (or accept a prerecorded audio file) and mix it into the video using FFmpeg. This lets the same visual sequence be re-used with different narrations (English, French, Spanish) without regenerating any VEO clips. Huge cost saver for multi-language deliverables.
- **Audio strategy reference doc** — Write `references/video-audio.md` additions that cover the three modes, when to use which, VEO's dialogue limitations, and how to structure prompts for each case. Also document the hybrid case: VEO generates ambient + SFX during the shot, post-production adds voiceover on top.

#### Prompt engineering — Discoveries captured in video-prompt-engineering.md

The specific prompt engineering discoveries from this demo have been captured in `skills/video/references/video-prompt-engineering.md` under a new **"Discoveries and Tips from Real Sequence Production"** section. That file is the long-term home for learnings that accumulate over time as we run more sequences.

**Initial tips captured** (see the reference file for full details and examples):

1. Scene bible anchors locked across prompts — identical phrasing, not paraphrases ✅
2. Off-frame composition beats forcing all elements visible ✅
3. Explicit percentage framing for camera moves ✅
4. Image-to-image has conservatism bias ✅
5. ALL CAPS for anatomical and count constraints 🔬
6. Real camera brand names anchor color and grade ✅
7. Audio is three distinct things, not one ✅
8. Not every shot needs an end frame ✅
9. Hybrid storyboard generation (text-only for first frames, image-reference for continuations) ✅

**Evidence levels used in the reference file:**
- ✅ **Demonstrated** — observed in real generation output, bug or improvement reproducible
- 🔬 **Unverified** — reasonable guess from general knowledge or one-shot observation, not yet eval-tested
- 📊 **Measured** — backed by a formal eval run with multiple samples (none yet)

This honest framing means future developers know which tips to trust and which to test. When v3.5.0 implementation work starts, the 🔬 Unverified tips should be targeted for eval runs to promote them to 📊 Measured.

#### VEO API integration fixes already shipped in v3.4.1

These bugs were discovered during the first real VEO test and are documented here so future developers understand the pitfalls:

- ✅ `personGeneration: "allow_adult"` rejected for text-to-video — only omit it, or use `"allow_all"`
- ✅ Image format is `inlineData.data`, not `bytesBase64Encoded`
- ✅ Response path is `response.generateVideoResponse.generatedSamples[0].video.uri`, not `response.generatedSamples`
- ✅ Video URIs require the API key as a query parameter for authenticated download

#### New v3.6.0 items surfaced during v3.5.0 research

- **`--num-videos` flag (1–4 per API call)** — VEO 3.1 supports generating up to 4 variations in a single `predictLongRunning` request, amortizing the setup/denoise overhead. Adds a new output shape (array of paths). Overlaps with the banana skill's `/banana ab-test` — might belong there instead.
- **Object insertion support** — VEO 3.1 can add elements into generated video while maintaining consistent lighting and physics. New flag probably looks like `--insert-object <image.png> --insert-description "a coffee cup on the table"`.
- **Parallel batch execution in `video_sequence.py`** — Currently shots are generated sequentially. Up to 10 concurrent operations are allowed per project. Parallel execution would cut a 4-shot sequence wall-clock from ~4 min to ~1 min at the cost of losing the "fail fast on shot 1" pattern.
- **`output_gcs_uri` support** — Write directly to Cloud Storage instead of downloading and re-uploading. Required for workflows that need videos to outlive the 48-hour retention window without local storage.
- **Regional restrictions awareness** — Detect EEA/Swiss/UK locale and warn when image-to-video features will be restricted. Also surface the `personGeneration: allow_adult` default in those regions.
- **1080p Lite pricing verification** — The reference doc only explicitly states $0.05/sec for 720p Lite. 1080p Lite pricing is unverified. Run a real API call to confirm and update the PRICING dict.
- **Character consistency improvements** — VEO's character drift is a documented limitation. Consider routing character-heavy shots through Replicate backends (Kling 2.6, Seedance 2.0) which handle multi-shot consistency better.

#### Cost and workflow wins to preserve

These worked well and should be documented in the video-sequences reference so future users follow the same pattern:

- **Storyboard:video cost ratio is 15×** ($0.08 per frame vs ~$1.20 per clip) — this is the economic argument for the approval gate. A 30-second, 4-shot sequence costs $0.64 in storyboard and $4.50 in video. If one frame has a bug, the cost of a storyboard regeneration is 0.13% of the cost of regenerating the corresponding clip.
- **Sequential VEO testing over parallel** — fire one clip, inspect it, then decide whether to proceed. A bug found on clip 1 avoids burning 3× the cost on clips 2-4.
- **Hybrid generation mode for storyboard** — use text-only for the first frame of each shot (full control), then image-reference chaining for subsequent frames (consistency). Cross-shot continuity (e.g., the cup in shot 3 end → shot 4 start) uses image-reference.

---

## Future Considerations

- **Figma Plugin Bridge** — Export to Figma frames via API
- **CMS Integration** — Auto-upload to WordPress, Contentful, Sanity
- **E-Commerce Automation** — Connect to Shopify/WooCommerce for product shots
- **3D Object Generation** — When model support exists
- **Interactive Prototypes** — Generate clickable UI mockups
- **Team Collaboration** — Shared presets via git repo

### Completed research spikes

All 6 spikes from the strategic reset session are now completed:

- **Spikes 1-3** (audio architecture): shipped in v3.7.1
- **Spike 4** (5-way music bake-off): shipped in v3.7.2 (Lyria won). **Overridden by v3.8.3** 12-genre bake-off (ElevenLabs won 12-0).
- **Spike 5** (character consistency bake-off): shipped in v3.8.0 (Kling default). **Extended by v3.8.2** (start_image identity lock discovery).
- **Spike 6** (banned-keywords re-validation): shipped in v3.7.3.
- **Seedance 2.0 retest**: completed in v3.8.1. **Verdict: permanently rejected** for human-subject workflows.
- **DreamActor M2.0 smoke test**: completed in v3.8.2 session 19. Identity preservation works but Kling + matched prompt is cheaper and higher quality for the primary use case. DreamActor deferred to v3.9.x for real-footage-to-avatar niche.

### Future research backlog

Items that came up during sessions 12–15 but don't have committed target releases yet. Most of the v3.7.1/v3.7.2 polish debt from the earlier version of this list (multi-call Lyria, stereo mix, auto-WPM, IVC) shipped in v3.7.4 — this list is now forward-looking rather than known-issues.

**Audio research:**
- ~~**Lyria-vs-ElevenLabs head-to-head genre bake-off**~~ **COMPLETED in v3.8.3 (session 19, 2026-04-16).** 12-genre blind A/B test: ElevenLabs won all 12 genres. `DEFAULT_MUSIC_SOURCE` flipped to `"elevenlabs"`. Lyria available via `--music-source lyria`.

**Audio polish still deferred:**
- **Professional Voice Cloning (PVC) subcommand** — separate endpoint family (`/v1/voices/pvc/*`), needs 30+ minutes of audio + Creator+ plan + multi-step fine-tuning workflow. Reserved under the existing `source_type: "cloned"` enum as a future `design_method: "pvc"`. Targets v3.9.x+.
- ~~**Strip-list extensibility via config file**~~ **COMPLETED in v3.8.4.** `strip_named_creators()` now checks `~/.banana/config.json` `named_creator_triggers` list before falling back to the hardcoded defaults.
- ~~**"in the style of X" compound-phrase stripping**~~ **COMPLETED in v3.8.4.** Dangling wrapper phrases ("in the style of", "inspired by", "reminiscent of", etc.) are now cleaned up after creator name removal.

**Orthogonal video capabilities surfaced in session 15 dev-docs additions:**

Two model cards added to `../dev-docs/` in session 15 solve jobs the plugin currently cannot do at all. They're NOT spike 5 bake-off candidates (which are general text-to-video alternatives to VEO) — they're new product surfaces. See the workspace `CLAUDE.md` "Specialised video capabilities" section for the full details.

- **`/video animate-character` via ByteDance DreamActor M2.0** — motion transfer from real filmed footage onto a generated avatar. Input: one character image + one driving video of a real person performing. Output: the character image animated with the driving video's motion. **Deferred to v3.9.x** — session 19 (2026-04-16) proved that Kling v3 Std's `start_image` + a character-matching prompt already handles the primary brand-consistency use case (generated characters doing scripted actions) natively at 2.5× lower cost and 1.5× higher resolution than DreamActor. DreamActor's remaining niche is narrower: real-footage-to-avatar workflows where a user films themselves and wants to map a generated avatar onto their performance.

- **`/video lipsync` via VEED Fabric 1.0** — audio-driven talking head. Input: one face image + one audio file (ANY audio — including an ElevenLabs TTS output from the v3.7.x audio pipeline). Output: the face lip-synced to the audio. This is structurally different from VEO's "person speaking" mode: VEO generates the speech internally and can't accept external audio, so there's no way to have a VEO character speak an ElevenLabs voice-designed narrator line. Fabric closes that loop. **Integration sketch:** `audio_pipeline.py narrate --voice brand_voice --text "..."` → Fabric with a banana-generated face → ship-ready talking-head reel. Targets a v3.8.x research release.

**All planned spikes completed.** No remaining deferred spike budget. Future spikes will be scoped and budgeted per-session as needed.
