# CLAUDE.md -- Development context for banana-claude

This file is read by Claude Code when working inside this repository.

**Start every session by reading `PROGRESS.md`** -- it has full development
history, design decisions, and next steps.

## What this repo is

`banana-claude` is a Claude Code **plugin** that enables AI image generation
using Google's Gemini Nano Banana models via MCP. Claude acts as a Creative
Director: it interprets intent, selects domain expertise, constructs
optimized prompts, and orchestrates Gemini API calls.

## Plugin structure

This repo follows the official Claude Code plugin layout:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` -- Plugin manifest
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` -- Marketplace catalog for distribution
- `skills/banana/` -- The main skill (SKILL.md + references + scripts)
- `agents/` -- Subagents (brief-constructor)

## Model status (as of March 2026)

- `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` -- **Active default.** Nano Banana 2.
- `gemini-2.5-flash-image` -- **Active.** Nano Banana original. Budget/free tier.
- `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` -- **DEAD.** Shut down March 9, 2026. Do not use.

## How to test changes

1. Test as plugin: `claude --plugin-dir .`
2. Or install standalone: `bash install.sh`
3. Test basic generation: `/banana generate "a red apple on a white table"`
4. Test domain routing: `/banana generate "product shot for headphones"`
5. Test editing: `/banana edit [path] "make the background blurry"`
6. Verify output image files exist at the logged path
7. Check cost log if cost_tracker.py is active

## File responsibilities

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `skills/banana/SKILL.md` | Main orchestrator. Edit to change Claude's behavior. |
| `skills/banana/references/gemini-models.md` | Model roster, routing table, resolution tables, input limits. Update when Google releases new models. |
| `skills/banana/references/prompt-engineering.md` | The prompt construction system: 5-component formula, 11 domain modes, PEEL strategy, brand guide integration. Update when Google publishes new guidance. |
| `skills/banana/references/mcp-tools.md` | MCP tool parameter reference. Update when Google changes the API. |
| `skills/banana/references/replicate.md` | Replicate backend API reference (`google/nano-banana-2`). |
| `skills/banana/references/presets.md` | Brand Style Guide schema (17 fields, 8 optional for brand guides). |
| `skills/banana/scripts/generate.py` | Direct Gemini API fallback for generation. Uses urllib.request (stdlib). |
| `skills/banana/scripts/edit.py` | Direct Gemini API fallback for editing. Uses urllib.request (stdlib). |
| `skills/banana/scripts/replicate_generate.py` | Replicate API fallback for generation. Uses urllib.request (stdlib). |
| `skills/banana/scripts/replicate_edit.py` | Replicate API fallback for editing. Uses urllib.request (stdlib). |
| `skills/banana/scripts/presets.py` | Brand Style Guide CRUD (list, show, create, delete). |
| `agents/brief-constructor.md` | Subagent for prompt construction. |

## Scripts use stdlib only

All fallback scripts (`generate.py`, `edit.py`, `replicate_generate.py`, `replicate_edit.py`)
use Python's `urllib.request` to call APIs directly. They have ZERO pip dependencies by design.
Do NOT add `google-genai`, `requests`, or `replicate` as dependencies -- the stdlib approach
ensures the skill works on any system with Python 3.6+.

## Key constraints

- `imageSize` parameter values must be UPPERCASE: "1K", "2K", "4K". Lowercase fails silently.
- Gemini generates ONE image per API call. There is no batch parameter.
- No negative prompt parameter exists. Use semantic reframing in the prompt.
- `responseModalities` must explicitly include "IMAGE" or the API returns text only.
- NEVER use banned keywords in prompts: "8K", "masterpiece", "ultra-realistic", "high resolution" -- these degrade output quality. Use prestigious context anchors instead (see prompt-engineering.md).
- NEVER mention "logo" in Presentation mode prompts -- the model generates unwanted logo artifacts. Describe the area as "clean negative space" instead. Logos are composited in presentation software.
- Brand Style Guide fields in presets are optional -- old presets without them continue to work.
- Fallback chain: MCP (primary) -> Direct Gemini API -> Replicate.

## Upstream tracking

This is a fork of https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/banana-claude (v1.4.1 baseline).

To check for upstream changes:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git diff upstream/main
```

Our additions over upstream: Replicate backend, Presentation mode, Brand Style Guides,
research-driven prompt improvements (5-Input Creative Brief, PEEL strategy, Edit-First,
Progressive Enhancement, expanded character consistency, multilingual support).

## Installation

Test locally: `claude --plugin-dir .` or standalone: `bash install.sh`

## Feature Completion Checklist

**MANDATORY: After completing ANY feature or significant change, run through this
entire checklist before committing.** Do not skip items. Do not batch them for later.

### 1. Version Bump (ALL 4 files)

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version"` field |
| `skills/banana/SKILL.md` | `metadata.version` in YAML frontmatter |
| `README.md` | Version badge number in shields.io URL |
| `CITATION.cff` | `version` field + `date-released` to today |

Do NOT set version in `marketplace.json` -- it conflicts with `plugin.json`.

### 2. Documentation Updates

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add new `## [X.Y.Z]` section with Added/Changed/Fixed. Add link reference at bottom. |
| `README.md` | Update "What's New in This Fork" section if feature is user-facing. Update architecture diagram if new files created. Update commands table if new commands added. |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Add session entry with numbered list of what was done. Update priority table if roadmap item completed. Update version in header. |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Mark completed features. Update version reference. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Update file responsibilities table if new files created. Update key constraints if new rules added. |

### 3. Cross-File Consistency Check

After all edits, verify these match across files:
- **Version number** identical in all 4 version files
- **Command list** in SKILL.md Quick Reference matches README Commands table
- **File list** in CLAUDE.md file responsibilities table matches what exists on disk
- **Model names** and **rate limits** consistent across gemini-models.md, cost-tracking.md, mcp-tools.md
- **Aspect ratios** consistent across gemini-models.md, replicate.md, generate.py, replicate_generate.py

### 4. SKILL.md Size Check

```bash
wc -l skills/banana/SKILL.md  # Must stay under 500 lines
```

Current: ~170 lines (lean orchestrator pattern). If approaching 300+, extract to reference files.

### 5. Memory File

Update `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_banana_claude_workflow.md` if:
- Version changed
- New key constraints added
- Architecture changed (e.g., new skill files, new reference files)

### 6. Git Commit

Stage specific files (not `git add -A`). Commit with descriptive message following the pattern:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation only
- `refactor:` for restructuring

Push to fork: `git push origin main`

## Plugin development notes

- `.claude-plugin/` contains ONLY `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`. Never put skills, agents, or commands in this directory.
- `skills/` and `agents/` must be at plugin root (not inside `.claude-plugin/`).
- Plugin variable `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the plugin cache directory. Use for hook commands and MCP configs.
- SKILL.md uses `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for script paths -- this is a semantic marker Claude interprets based on context. Works in both plugin and standalone mode.
- Relative paths in SKILL.md (`references/`, `scripts/`) resolve relative to SKILL.md location. These work in both modes.
- Test locally with `claude --plugin-dir .` (loads plugin without installing).
- After changes, run `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code to pick up updates without restarting.
- Validate with `claude plugin validate .` or `/plugin validate .` before releasing.
