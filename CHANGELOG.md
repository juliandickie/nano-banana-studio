# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **`/banana slides` pipeline** -- three-step batch slide deck generation:
  - `plan` -- Claude analyzes content and writes detailed visual design briefs
  - `prompts` -- Claude converts briefs to Nano Banana Pro prompts
  - `generate` -- `slides.py` batch-generates all slide images from prompts markdown
- **`slides.py`** script with `generate`, `estimate`, and `template` subcommands
- 4 new slide-type prompt templates: quote, section divider, image feature, infographic process
- `references/setup.md` -- extracted setup instructions for lazy loading

### Changed
- **SKILL.md restructured as lean orchestrator** (496 → 170 lines, 66% reduction)
  - Detailed content moved to lazy-loaded reference files
  - Duplicated tables (domain modes, aspect ratios, resolutions) removed -- single source in references
  - Setup instructions extracted to `references/setup.md`
  - 330 lines of headroom for future features (social, brand builder, video)
- Version bumped across all 4 files (plugin.json, SKILL.md, README, CITATION.cff)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Presentation domain mode** with two generation options:
  - **Complete Slide** -- model renders headline/body text directly (leverages Nano Banana 2's 94% text accuracy)
  - **Background Only** -- clean backgrounds with negative space for layering in Keynote/PPT/Slides
- **Brand Style Guides** -- 8 new optional preset fields for project-wide visual consistency:
  - `background_styles` -- named background variants (dark-premium, gradient, split-layout)
  - `visual_motifs` -- pattern overlays with opacity
  - `prompt_suffix` -- appended verbatim to every prompt
  - `prompt_keywords` -- categorized keywords woven into prompts
  - `do_list` / `dont_list` -- brand guardrails checked before generation
  - `logo_placement` -- records post-production logo position (never mentioned in prompts)
  - `technical_specs` -- default color space, DPI, etc.
- **Logo exclusion rule** -- logos are NEVER mentioned in prompts (model generates artifacts). Described as "clean negative space" instead; logos composited in presentation software
- Presentation mode modifier library in prompt-engineering.md (background styles, layout zones, typography, pattern overlays, slide types)
- 4 Presentation prompt templates (2 Complete, 2 Background-Only)
- Brand Style Guide Integration section in prompt-engineering.md
- Expanded merge rules (items 6-12) for brand guide fields in presets.md
- 8 new CLI args in presets.py for brand guide creation
- README updated with new feature documentation, rationale, and upstream tracking

### Changed
- Domain modes expanded from 9 to 11 (Presentation Complete + Background)
- presets.py `create` command accepts brand guide fields (backward-compatible)
- Logo handling rewritten: replaced "reserve space for logo" with negative-space approach
