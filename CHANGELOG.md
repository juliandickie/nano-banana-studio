## [3.6.2] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**Sequence production polish.** Five small-but-high-value improvements surfaced by the coffee shop demo that shipped earlier today — the ones you notice the moment you run a real 4-shot sequence end-to-end. Zero new VEO API calls to verify; everything tested against fixture plans.

### Added

- **`video_sequence.py review` subcommand** — generates `REVIEW-SHEET.md` from a plan + storyboard directory. Each shot block shows frames inline, the full VEO prompt, resolved model + cost for the selected `--quality-tier`, and a ✅/⚠️ status badge. Sequence totals and any gaps blocking `generate` appear in the footer. Pure markdown, regenerated on demand, opens in Quick Look. This is the human approval gate between `storyboard` and `generate` that was previously an undocumented hand-written step. v3.6.2 ships it as a standalone subcommand; a `--skip-review` mandatory-gate integration is v3.6.3 scope.
- **5-stage pipeline**: `plan → storyboard → **review** → generate → stitch`. The review stage is now first-class in the docs, the SKILL.md routing table, the README Commands table, and the Quick Start example.
- **`use_veo_interpolation: true` per-shot flag in plan.json** — shots that should let VEO pick their own ending (establishing shots cutting away to unrelated material, transitions, etc.) can set this. The storyboard stage skips the end frame for those shots (saves $0.08/frame) and the generate stage drops `--last-frame` from the VEO call. Empirically validated by the coffee shop demo's Shot 1 where we used first-frame-only to let VEO execute a dramatic push-in. The field defaults to False so existing plans keep the strict first+last frame behavior.
- **`video_sequence.py storyboard --shots 1,3-5` partial regeneration** — new `--shots` flag accepts a comma-separated list of shot numbers and/or hyphen ranges. When set, the storyboard stage only regenerates the selected shots instead of rebuilding the whole storyboard. Critical for iteration when one frame has a bug but others are approved.
- **`_parse_shots_filter()` helper** in `video_sequence.py` — accepts `"1,3,5"`, `"2-4"`, `"1,3-5,7"`, or any mix. Validates and fails fast with a clear error on garbled input.
- **`_sanitize_project_name()` helper** — builds filesystem-safe slugs for per-project output subdirs. `"Golden Bean Cafe — 30s"` becomes `"golden-bean-cafe-30s"`.

### Changed

- **Default output location** is now `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences/` (was `~/Documents/nanobanana_generated/`). Visible from Finder, works with Quick Look (Space key), per-project subdirs when a project name is provided. `LEGACY_OUTPUT_BASE` still points at the old path for documentation continuity.
- **`_default_output(suffix, project_name=None)`** now accepts an optional `project_name` argument. With a project name, the layout becomes `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences/<project-slug>/<suffix>/` so all stages of one project cluster together.
- **Storyboard stage cost accounting** — shots with `use_veo_interpolation=true` only charge for one frame ($0.08) instead of two ($0.16). The estimate subcommand and the review sheet both reflect this.
- **`cmd_storyboard()` missing-frame error messages** now distinguish "missing start frame" (always fatal) from "missing end frame" (fatal only when `use_veo_interpolation=false`). The error text also points users at the flag they can set to unblock themselves.

### Docs

- **`video-sequences.md`** section "The 4-Stage Pipeline" renamed to "The 5-Stage Pipeline" with a new Stage 3 (Review) block describing the review subcommand, its cost-free nature, and the decision not to hard-enforce the gate in v3.6.2.
- **`SKILL.md`** Commands table and narrative section updated with the review subcommand, partial regeneration flag, and `use_veo_interpolation` option.
- **`README.md`** Commands table, Quick Start example, and What's New section all updated.

### Verification

- All 4 video scripts still compile clean.
- `_parse_shots_filter` unit test covers the four supported syntaxes (None, `"1,3,5"`, `"2-4"`, `"1,3-5,7"`).
- Real-data test: ran `video_sequence.py review --plan /tmp/coffee-shop-demo/plan.json --storyboard /tmp/coffee-shop-demo/storyboard --quality-tier draft` against the coffee shop demo fixture from earlier today. With Shot 1 marked `use_veo_interpolation=true` and filename symlinks in place, the review sheet reports 4/4 ready, $0.55 storyboard cost, $1.50 video cost (Lite draft), $2.05 total, and the Shot 1 block correctly shows "first-frame-only (VEO interpolates ending)" with no end-frame slot.
- **Zero new VEO spend this release** — all testing used fixtures from earlier v3.6.1 work.

### Not in scope for v3.6.2 (deferred to v3.6.3+)

Everything else in the original v3.6.1 deferred bucket: plan hash tracking with SHA-256, the `update-prompts` Gemini-vision subcommand, the review-as-mandatory-gate enforcement with `--skip-review`, the audio strategy split (narration/dialogue/ambient/sfx fields), the `/video sequence narration` TTS subcommand, shot-type semantic effects, `/banana` skill improvements (`--reference-image` flag on `generate.py`, conservatism bias docs), and the v3.6.0-research batch (`--num-videos`, object insertion, parallel execution, `output_gcs_uri`, regional detection, 1080p Lite pricing verification). These items need their own dedicated releases with proper plans — especially the audio strategy split which is a real product decision, not a code change.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**First+last frame interpolation and reference images now work on the Vertex AI backend.** v3.6.0 shipped the Vertex backend with `--first-frame` support but deferred `--last-frame` and `--reference-image` to v3.6.1 because the field names weren't empirically verified. Two authoritative Google doc pages published in the [Vertex first/last frame reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/video/generate-videos-from-first-and-last-frames) and the [Gemini API video guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video) confirmed the field names as `lastFrame` (camelCase, nested at the instance level alongside `image`) and `referenceImages` (an array of `{image, referenceType: "asset"}` entries). Wiring them in took ~40 lines in `_vertex_backend.build_vertex_request_body` plus removing the `_error_exit` stubs in `_submit_vertex_ai`. Verified end-to-end with a Lite first+last frame smoke test ($0.20) using coffee shop Shot 2's storyboard frames — real 2.27 MB MP4 produced in 42 seconds.

### Added
- **`last_frame_path` parameter** on `_vertex_backend.build_vertex_request_body`. Builds the `lastFrame` field as a sibling of `image` at the instance level with `bytesBase64Encoded` + `mimeType`. Same camelCase field name used by both the Vertex AI REST reference and the Gemini API docs.
- **`reference_image_paths` parameter** on `_vertex_backend.build_vertex_request_body`. Builds the `referenceImages` array (up to 3 entries) with each entry as `{image: {bytesBase64Encoded, mimeType}, referenceType: "asset"}`. Matches the structure shown in the official Google Veo 3 notebook and the Gemini API bash curl example.
- **Four new mutual-exclusion checks** in `build_vertex_request_body`: (1) `video_input` cannot combine with any image inputs, (2) `last_frame` requires `image` (since `lastFrame` is always paired), (3) `reference_images` cannot combine with `image` or `last_frame` (separate Vertex code paths), (4) `reference_images` capped at 3 entries.

### Fixed
- **`--last-frame` on the Vertex AI backend** — v3.6.0 raised `_error_exit("--last-frame is not yet supported on the Vertex AI backend")`. v3.6.1 lets it through to the wire. Works for all five VEO 3.1 model IDs (Standard/Fast/Lite, both preview and GA `-001`). VEO 3.0 does not support first+last frame per Vertex docs; the API will reject it with a clear error if a user tries.
- **`--reference-image` on the Vertex AI backend** — same deferred-error was removed. Vertex supports reference images for all VEO 3.1 tiers except Lite per Google's parameter table; Lite requests with reference images will be rejected by the API.

### Docs
- **`_vertex_backend.py` docstring** on `build_vertex_request_body` rewritten with the full list of input modes (text-to-video, image-to-video, first+last interpolation, reference-guided, Scene Extension v2) and their mutual exclusions.
- **`_submit_vertex_ai` docstring** updated to note the v3.6.1 additions and link to the source docs.

### Verification
- 8 new unit checks on `build_vertex_request_body` covering last_frame, reference_images, and all 4 new mutual-exclusion rules. The original 18 commit-1 checks still pass.
- Real API ($0.20): Lite first+last frame on coffee shop Shot 2 storyboard frames, 42s wall clock, 2.27 MB MP4 saved to `/tmp/v361-smoke/`.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**Vertex AI backend with API-key auth — unblocks the full VEO 3.1 capability surface.** The Gemini API surface (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) the plugin had been using only serves text-to-video on two preview model IDs. v3.5.0 documented every other VEO feature as "Vertex AI only — gated until v3.6.0" — image-to-video, Lite, Legacy 3.0, GA `-001` IDs, and Scene Extension v2 all returned clear errors instead of silent HTTP 404s. v3.6.0 wires up the Vertex AI backend with a stdlib-only request translator using bound-to-service-account API key auth (no OAuth, no service account JSON, no `gcloud` install required), un-gates everything, and re-points `--quality-tier draft` from the v3.5.0 Fast stopgap back to Lite for the full **8× cost reduction**.

### Fixed
- **Image-to-video / `--first-frame` / `--last-frame` / `--reference-image`** — the Gemini API surface stopped serving image-to-video for VEO when the GA `-001` IDs shipped on Vertex AI in March 2026. v3.6.0's Vertex backend handles all of these. `video_generate.py --first-frame` works again.
- **`video_extend.py --method video` (Scene Extension v2)** — re-enabled as the default. The Vertex API accepts inline base64 video input via `instances[0].video.bytesBase64Encoded` (despite Google's docs only showing the `gcsUri` path). Verified end-to-end with a 1.69 MB → 4.5 MB MP4 generation.
- **Lite duration constraint** — v3.5.0 documented Lite as supporting 5–60 second durations based on unverified docs. Real-API testing during v3.6.0 showed the API explicitly rejects 5-second Lite requests with `"supported durations are [8,4,6] for feature text_to_video"`. Lite is `{4, 6, 8}` like every other tier. The error message and argparse help text are corrected.
- **1:1 aspect ratio claim for Lite** — v3.5.0 documented `1:1` as a Lite-only special-case based on unverified docs. The Vertex docs and the official Google Veo 3 notebook both list only `16:9` and `9:16`. v3.6.0 removes the special-case from `_valid_ratios()` and `video_generate.py`, and adds defense-in-depth validation in the Vertex request body builder.
- **`video_extend.py GENERATE_DURATION` for Scene Extension v2** — was hardcoded to `8` (correct for the keyframe path) but Vertex's `feature=video_extension` accepts only `durationSeconds=7`. Replaced with two named constants `GENERATE_DURATION_KEYFRAME=8` and `GENERATE_DURATION_VIDEO=7`, dispatched via `_hop_duration_for_method()`.

### Added
- **`skills/video/scripts/_vertex_backend.py`** (NEW, ~650 lines) — pure data translation helper module for the Vertex AI VEO surface. Handles URL composition (regional + global endpoints, hard-coded `/v1/` to avoid SDK [issue #2079](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai/issues/2079) routing bug), request body construction (`instances`/`parameters` wrapper with `bytesBase64Encoded` image/video parts, resolution normalization `4K → 4k`, defense-in-depth aspect ratio + Scene Extension v2 duration validation), submit + poll response parsing (handles all three known response shapes including the Vertex `cloud.ai.large_models.vision.GenerateVideoResponse` payload), and a `--diagnose` CLI for verifying the auth setup against a free Gemini text-gen sanity check.
- **`--backend {auto,gemini-api,vertex-ai}` flag** on `video_generate.py`, default `auto`. Routes Vertex-only features through Vertex automatically and keeps text-to-video on Gemini API for v3.4.x compat. Zero breaking changes for existing users.
- **`--vertex-api-key` / `--vertex-project` / `--vertex-location` flags** on `video_generate.py` with the same precedence as `--api-key`: CLI flag → env var → `~/.banana/config.json`.
- **`vertex_api_key` / `vertex_project_id` / `vertex_location` fields** in `~/.banana/config.json`. Backward compat: existing configs without these fields continue to work for the Gemini API path.
- **Service-agent provisioning auto-retry** — the first Scene Extension v2 call against a fresh Vertex project returns a transient `"Service agents are being provisioned"` error (gRPC code 9) that auto-resolves in ~60-90 s. `video_generate.py` detects this specific error and retries once after a 90-second sleep, with a clear progress event explaining the wait. Subsequent failures surface to the user with a pointer to the Vertex AI service-agents doc.
- **Scene Extension v2 duration auto-override** — `video_generate.py` auto-overrides `--duration` to `7` when `--video-input` routes to Vertex (matches the auto-720p-downgrade pattern v3.5.0 added).
- **`backend` field in output JSON** — every successful generation now reports which backend produced it (`"backend": "gemini-api"` or `"backend": "vertex-ai"`).

### Changed
- **`--quality-tier draft` re-pointed from Fast to Lite** in `video_sequence.py`. The v3.5.0 stopgap mapped `draft` to Fast ($0.15/sec, 2.7× cheaper than Standard) because Lite was unreachable. v3.6.0 restores the original mapping to Lite ($0.05/sec, **8× cheaper**). On a 4-shot 30-second sequence, the draft pass cost drops from $4.80 to $1.60.
- **`video_extend.py --method` default flipped from `keyframe` back to `video`** (Scene Extension v2). The legacy keyframe path remains available via `--method keyframe` for users who need 1080p extension.
- **`download_expires_at` is now backend-scoped** — only emitted on the Gemini API path (where the 48-hour URI expiry actually applies). The Vertex AI path returns video bytes inline in the poll response, so there's no URI and no expiry. The stderr 48-hour warning is also Gemini-only.
- **`_submit_operation`, `_poll_operation`, `_save_video`** in `video_generate.py` are now backend-aware dispatchers. The Gemini API code paths are preserved byte-identical for backward compat; the Vertex paths call into the new `_vertex_backend` module.

### Docs
- **Full rewrite of `skills/video/references/veo-models.md`** Backend Availability section. Removes the v3.5.0 "Vertex AI only — gated" warnings, documents the 3-minute auth setup, explains why API-key auth works for Vertex (bound-to-service-account keys carry a service account principal), corrects the Lite duration and aspect ratio claims, lists the canonical protobuf type names from the REST reference (`VideoGenerationModelInstance`, `VideoGenerationModelParams`, `cloud.ai.large_models.vision.GenerateVideoResponse`), and explains that video retention only applies to the Gemini API path.
- **`skills/video/references/video-sequences.md` draft-then-final cost table** restored to the 8× story. The v3.5.0 "Gemini API today vs Vertex AI later" two-table workaround is gone — there's now one cost comparison and Lite is the default draft tier.
- **`skills/video/SKILL.md` Model Routing table** is back to 5 rows (draft / quick social / standard / hero / image-to-video / legacy) with a Backend column showing where each routes. The "Vertex AI only — gated" callout is gone.
- **README "What's New" section** rewritten with the v3.6.0 backend story.
- **CLAUDE.md** updated with the new helper script in the file responsibilities table and a new key-constraint about Vertex resolution case (`4k` lowercase) vs Gemini convention (`4K` uppercase).
- **ROADMAP** marks v3.6.0 as shipped, removes the "Vertex AI backend" line from the top, and promotes the deferred sequence production improvements to v3.6.1.

### Verification
- **Real API:** $0.55 spent across three smoke tests during research ($0.20 Lite text-to-video, $0.20 Lite image-to-video, $0.35 Lite Scene Extension v2 with retry) plus $0.20 for the commit 2 integration smoke test. Real MP4 artifacts saved to `/tmp/v360-verify/` and `/tmp/v360-commit2/` for inspection.
- **Zero-cost:** all 4 modified scripts compile clean, 18 unit checks via import on `_vertex_backend.py`, backend routing tested for all 4 combinations (auto + Gemini path, auto + Vertex path, explicit Gemini, explicit Vertex), 1:1 aspect rejection verified, Lite duration 4 acceptance verified, draft tier cost calculation confirmed at $1.11 for the test plan (down from $2.71).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### ⚠️ Backend Reality Check

Real-API verification during the v3.5.0 release surfaced a critical distinction: **VEO 3.1 is split across two backends**. The plugin uses the Gemini API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, API-key auth), while Lite, Legacy 3.0, GA `-001` IDs for Standard/Fast, and Scene Extension v2 (`--video-input`) are **Vertex AI only** (`*-aiplatform.googleapis.com`, OAuth/service-account auth). The Gemini API returns HTTP 404 for every `-001` ID and rejects `--video-input` with "inlineData isn't supported by this model." Until the Vertex AI backend ships in v3.6.0, the plugin gates these features with clear error messages and remaps `--quality-tier draft` to Fast instead of Lite. See `skills/video/references/veo-models.md` → Backend Availability for full details. Vertex AI support is now tracked as the top v3.6.0 roadmap item.

### Fixed
- **VEO Lite model ID** — the plugin previously shipped `veo-3.1-generate-lite-preview` which does not exist as a real API endpoint. v3.5.0 ships the correct GA ID `veo-3.1-lite-generate-001` for users running against Vertex AI directly, and documents it for the Gemini API path with a clear error pointing at the v3.6.0 Vertex AI backend.
- **VEO pricing** — the cost tracker's Standard rate was incorrectly set to $0.15/sec. Corrected to the official $0.40/sec ($3.20 per 8s clip) matching Google Cloud Vertex AI pricing. Fast ($0.15/sec) and Lite ($0.05/sec) tiers are now listed separately rather than conflated.

### Added
- **VEO 3.1 model variants** in `video_generate.py` — Fast tier (`veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview` / `-001`), Lite tier (`veo-3.1-lite-generate-001`), and Legacy 3.0 (`veo-3.0-generate-001`). Both preview and GA (`-001`) IDs are accepted for Standard and Fast.
- **Model-aware parameter validation** — Lite supports 5–60 s durations and 1:1 square aspect ratio; Standard/Fast reject those. 4K is rejected on Lite and Legacy 3.0.
- **`--negative-prompt`** flag on `video_generate.py` with Google's official guidance (describe what you want; use negatives only for known failure modes).
- **`--seed`** flag on `video_generate.py` for reproducible generations.
- **`--video-input`** flag on `video_generate.py` — Scene Extension v2 mode, mutually exclusive with image inputs, forces 720p.
- **`--quality-tier {draft,fast,standard,lite,legacy}`** flag on `video_sequence.py generate` and `estimate` — enables the draft-then-final workflow. `draft` currently maps to Fast ($0.15/sec, 2.7× cheaper than Standard) on the Gemini API; `lite` and `legacy` fail fast with a clear pointer to the v3.6.0 Vertex AI backend. A 4-shot 30-second sequence costs $4.80 at Fast draft vs $12.80 at Standard.
- **Per-shot and sequence-level `model`/`resolution` fields** in the plan.json schema, with a 3-level cascade (CLI override → shot → plan → default) and graceful fallback for old plans.
- **`--method {video,keyframe}`** flag on `video_extend.py`. Default is `video` (Scene Extension v2: passes previous clip directly, preserves audio continuity at 720p). `keyframe` retains the legacy last-frame extraction path at any resolution.
- **`--model` flag on `video_extend.py`** with per-hop cost estimation using the selected model's actual rate.
- **Token-limit prompt validation** in `video_generate.py` — warns at ~950 tokens (3,800 chars), hard-rejects at ~1,125 tokens (4,500 chars) to prevent confusing API-layer failures.
- **`download_expires_at` timestamp** in `video_generate.py` JSON output and a stderr warning about Google's 48-hour video retention window.
- **New `_veo_cost(model, duration_seconds)` helper** in `cost_tracker.py` with per-second fallback for Lite's extended 5–60 s range.
- **README: "VEO 3.1 Model Variants & Draft Workflow (v3.5.0)"** section.

### Changed
- **`video_extend.py` default method** is `keyframe` (last-frame extraction, works on the Gemini API today at any resolution). `--method video` (Scene Extension v2, preserves audio continuity) is documented but errors with a clear Vertex-AI-required message until v3.6.0.
- **`video_sequence.py` cost estimation** now uses real per-tier rates instead of a flat $1.20/clip. Output includes a per-model breakdown.
- **Video SKILL.md Model Routing table** rewritten with 5 scenarios (draft / quick social / standard / hero / legacy) and a draft-first recommendation.

### Docs
- **Full rewrite of `skills/video/references/veo-models.md`** with the VEO release timeline, 3-tier comparison table, GA vs preview IDs, 4K-is-AI-upscaled clarification, capability matrix, known limitations (character drift, text rendering, 8 s ceiling, silent output failures), 48-hour video retention, regional availability (EEA/Swiss/UK), rate limits, competitive context (Arena Elo 1381), and audio quality comparison.
- **`skills/video/references/video-sequences.md`** — new draft-then-final workflow section with cost comparison table, Gemini + VEO as Google's officially recommended pattern, timestamp prompting as a cost-reduction technique, and character drift mitigation framing.
- **`skills/video/references/video-prompt-engineering.md`** — new sections for timestamp prompting (`[00:00-00:02]` syntax), lens focal length guidance (16 mm / 35 mm / 50 mm / 85 mm table), dialogue timing (words-per-clip by duration), recommended negative prompt boilerplate, text rendering warning, and 100–200 word prompt-length target.
- **README** version badge bumped, model comparison table updated with all four VEO variants and per-second pricing.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-04-09
