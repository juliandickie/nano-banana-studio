## [4.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Headline

**Full rebrand from `nano-banana-studio` to `creators-studio`.** The plugin is now **Creators Studio — Creative Engine for Claude Code**, with the tagline *Imagine · Direct · Generate*. The old name anchored the product to a single Google model (Nano Banana) at a moment when the AI race is emphatically not finished — Kling v3 Std already beat VEO 3.1 to become the video default in v3.8.0, ElevenLabs Music beat Lyria to become the music default in v3.8.3, and the next best-in-class swap will happen again. The rename separates the product's identity from any one model so the plugin can continue absorbing new state-of-the-art engines without carrying a misleading brand.

This is a rename-only release. **No functional changes.** 77 files touched, ~425 string replacements, all 28 Python scripts compile cleanly.

### Changed

- **Plugin identifier**: `nano-banana-studio` → `creators-studio` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- **Command namespace**: `/banana` → `/create-image`, `/video` → `/create-video`. All 34 commands across both skills renamed. Example: `/banana generate` is now `/create-image generate`, `/video sequence` is now `/create-video sequence`.
- **Skill directories** renamed via `git mv` (preserves history):
  - `skills/banana/` → `skills/create-image/`
  - `skills/video/` → `skills/create-video/`
- **Default output directories** (created on first use of new versions):
  - `~/Documents/nanobanana_generated` → `~/Documents/creators_generated`
  - `~/Documents/nano-banana-audio` → `~/Documents/creators_audio`
  - `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences` → `~/Documents/creators_sequences`
  - Existing output directories are left in place — the script only creates the new dir on a fresh install.
- **Repository homepage + all README/doc references** updated from `github.com/juliandickie/nano-banana-studio` to `github.com/juliandickie/creators-studio`.
- **CITATION.cff** project name + repository-code URL updated.
- **All 28 Python scripts'** internal `Path(__file__)` traversal, help strings, User-Agent headers, and error messages updated to the new plugin name.
- **All 24 reference markdown files** (12 image-skill + 12 video-skill) updated for command name references.
- **Both SKILL.md orchestrators** (create-image + create-video) updated for command names and script paths.

### Preserved (backward compatibility)

- **`~/.banana/` config directory** is intentionally NOT renamed. API keys (`google_ai_api_key`, `replicate_api_token`, `elevenlabs_api_key`, `vertex_api_key`, `vertex_project_id`, `vertex_location`), custom voices, custom preset overrides, cost ledger, and session history all stay at the existing path. Existing users upgrade with zero config loss.
- **Google model identifiers** (`gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, `google/nano-banana-2`) are Google's brand — they stay unchanged. Renaming them would break the Replicate dispatch and Gemini API routes.
- **MCP package name** `@ycse/nanobanana-mcp` unchanged — it's a third-party upstream dependency the plugin doesn't own.

### Release process

- **GitHub repo renamed** from `juliandickie/nano-banana-studio` to `juliandickie/creators-studio` as a prerequisite. GitHub auto-redirects the old URL, so cloned forks continue to work, but new clones should use the new URL.
- **Release zip** renamed from `nano-banana-studio-vX.Y.Z.zip` to `creators-studio-vX.Y.Z.zip` pattern. Historical `banana-claude-vX.Y.Z.zip` and `nano-banana-studio-vX.Y.Z.zip` files at the workspace root are preserved as archived build artifacts — do not delete or rename them, as their URLs are public.

### Migration notes for existing users

1. Update your git remote: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/juliandickie/creators-studio.git`
2. Pull the latest: `git pull`
3. Commands change: replace `/banana` with `/create-image` and `/video` with `/create-video` in any scripts, aliases, or documentation you maintain.
4. Your `~/.banana/` config, API keys, voices, and presets **carry forward unchanged**.
5. Old output directories in `~/Documents/nanobanana_generated` etc. are left in place — move them to the new `creators_*` locations manually if you want a single canonical location.

## [3.8.4] - 2026-04-16

### Headline

**Replicate cost tracking + strip-list config extensibility + dangling-phrase cleanup.** A five-item housekeeping release that closes the last three ROADMAP items tagged "after v3.8.0" and brings the cost ledger up to date for Kling, DreamActor, and Fabric — which together account for most of the ~$62 cumulative video spend since spike 5 but were invisible in `~/.banana/costs.json` because the PRICING table was still image-only. This is the release that makes the analytics dashboard honest for video work.

### Added

- **Replicate video model pricing in `cost_tracker.py` PRICING dict** — three new entries, each with a `per_second` rate sourced from the authoritative Replicate model page or predictions dashboard:
  - `kwaivgi/kling-v3-video`: `$0.02/s` (model page)
  - `bytedance/dreamactor-m2.0`: `$0.05/s` (model page)
  - `veed/fabric-1.0`: `$0.15/s` (predictions dashboard, session 19 2026-04-16 — authoritative over the speculative $0.30/call figure from session 18's first lipsync.md draft)
- **`per_second` and `per_clip` pricing modes** in `cost_tracker._lookup_cost()` — the image-era function only handled resolution-keyed image pricing (`"512" | "1K" | "2K" | "4K"` → $). Now it branches on which pricing key is present: `per_second` (video models; duration passed as the `resolution` string e.g. `"8s"`), `per_clip` (Lyria — always $0.06), or the original resolution-keyed mode (Gemini image-gen). Lyria's existing `per_clip` entry was previously bypassed; it now works correctly.
- **Best-effort cost logging in `video_generate.py` and `video_lipsync.py`** — after a successful generation, the script shells out to `cost_tracker.py log` with the model name + duration. Uses `subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True, timeout=5)` with a bare `except Exception: pass` — cost logging **never blocks generation output** or returns a non-zero exit. Duration passed as `f"{args.duration}s"` to satisfy the new `per_second` branch.
- **`_load_custom_triggers()` helper in `audio_pipeline.py`** — reads `~/.banana/config.json` `named_creator_triggers` key (list). Returns the list if present and non-empty, else `None`. Called by `strip_named_creators()` before falling back to the hardcoded default.
- **`_DANGLING_PHRASES` module-level list in `audio_pipeline.py`** — eight wrapper phrases (`"in the style of"`, `"inspired by"`, `"reminiscent of"`, `"like"`, `"à la"`, `"a la"`, `"channeling"`, `"evoking"`) that commonly precede creator names. When the creator is stripped, these are detected and removed via a case-insensitive regex so `"in the style of Hans Zimmer, warm strings"` → `"warm strings"` instead of the v3.8.3 output `"in the style of , warm strings"`.

### Changed

- **`strip_named_creators()` trigger precedence** is now explicitly documented and three-tier:
  1. Explicit `triggers=` parameter passed by a caller (override)
  2. `named_creator_triggers` list in `~/.banana/config.json` (user override — NEW in v3.8.4)
  3. Hardcoded `NAMED_CREATOR_TRIGGERS` module constant (default)
  The function signature didn't change — the change is behavioral. Callers that don't care about the override path (which is all of them today) get the v3.8.3 behavior unless the config key is present.
- **`ROADMAP.md` housekeeping**: fixed duplicate "priority 9" rows (three `| 9 |` rows were clobbering each other in the table), consolidated the "Deferred research spikes" + "Pending spikes for v3.8.x" + "Future research backlog" sections into a single "Completed research spikes" block now that everything in the pending buckets has shipped, marked all items completed in v3.8.2 / v3.8.3 / v3.8.4, and struck through the "strip-list extensibility" + "compound-phrase stripping" entries that landed this release.

### Fixed

- **Lyria cost entries were unreachable pre-v3.8.4.** `PRICING["vertex/lyria-002"]` has `per_clip: 0.06` but `_lookup_cost()` only branched on the resolution-keyed image path and would emit `"Warning: Unknown resolution '32.768s'"` then fall through to 1K image pricing ($0.039). No real cost was miscomputed in practice because `audio_pipeline.py` never called `cost_tracker.py` for music — but the dead-code path is now live and correct.

### Release process

- **GitHub Releases published for v3.8.2 and v3.8.3** with plugin zips attached. Both had been tagged + pushed but the zip artifacts weren't uploaded. v3.8.4 catches those up as part of the housekeeping.

## [3.8.3] - 2026-04-16

### Headline

**ElevenLabs Music replaces Lyria 2 as the default music provider.** A 12-genre blind A/B bake-off (session 19, 2026-04-16, $0.72 Lyria cost) produced a decisive ElevenLabs **12-0 sweep**: cinematic, corporate, electronic, lo-fi, classical, ambient, jazz, acoustic, hip-hop, synthwave, world, and funk — ElevenLabs won every genre, each time by a clear margin. This overrides the v3.7.2 spike 4 finding where Lyria won a single-genre cinematic-documentary test. That result was a genre-specific anomaly — both providers were "very close and hard to pick" on cinematic, the one genre spike 4 tested.

`DEFAULT_MUSIC_SOURCE` in `audio_pipeline.py` flipped from `"lyria"` to `"elevenlabs"`. Lyria remains available via `--music-source lyria` for users who need `negative_prompt` exclusion or lack an ElevenLabs subscription.

### Changed

- **`audio_pipeline.py` `DEFAULT_MUSIC_SOURCE`** flipped from `"lyria"` to `"elevenlabs"`. CLI `--source` / `--music-source` flags still work for explicit provider selection; only the default changes.
- **`audio-pipeline.md`** fully rewritten for ElevenLabs-default: v3.8.3 update lede, provider summary table labels swapped, "When to use which" section updated (Lyria now the opt-in path for negative-prompt and no-subscription scenarios), architecture diagram labels updated, quick-start example updated to show ElevenLabs as the no-flag default and Lyria as the `--music-source lyria` opt-in.
- **Video `SKILL.md`** Quick Reference table updated: pipeline and music command descriptions now say "ElevenLabs default, Lyria alt". Audio pipeline section updated with the v3.8.3 bake-off citation.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** music provider default key constraint rewritten from Lyria to ElevenLabs with the 12-0 sweep finding + the single-genre-anomaly explanation.

### Research

- **Session 19 12-genre blind A/B bake-off (24 calls, $0.72 Lyria + ElevenLabs subscription)**. Methodology: identical positive prompt per genre for both providers, Lyria additionally gets `--negative-prompt "vocals, singing, lyrics, spoken word, voice, humming"` (its key differentiator), duration matched at ~32.768s, randomized A/B assignment (seed=42), user evaluated blind. Result: **ElevenLabs 12-0**. Per the user: "each winner was a clear winner and a definite difference in quality and interpretation" — the cinematic genre where spike 4 found Lyria winning was the one genre both providers were closest on. Spike artifacts at `/tmp/genre-bakeoff/` with `results.json`, `mapping.json`, `prompts.json`, and blind samples.
- **F13 confirmed from the other direction**: Lyria produces 1026 KB (48kHz/192kbps) vs ElevenLabs 512 KB (44.1kHz/128kbps). Higher bitrate and sample rate did not help — ElevenLabs won every genre. Spec-sheet metrics remain uncorrelated with perceived quality.

## [3.8.2] - 2026-04-16

### Headline

**Kling character consistency via start_image: the primary path for brand-character multi-clip work.** Session 19's spike (8 predictions, ~$1.10) proved that Kling v3 Std's `start_image` + a character-matching text prompt preserves character identity across separate generations at full 1072x1928 resolution — 1.5x higher resolution and 2.5x cheaper per clip than DreamActor M2.0 ($0.02/s vs $0.05/s). The critical finding: prompt engineering is the variable, not the model architecture. When the prompt describes the same character as the start image, identity locks. When it describes a different character, Kling morphs completely within 5 seconds. DreamActor M2.0 is deferred to v3.9.x for its narrower real-footage-to-avatar niche (filming yourself performing, then mapping a generated avatar onto your motion). This release adds orchestrator guidance, a new reference section in kling-models.md, and SKILL.md updates so Claude knows when and how to use start_image for character consistency.

### Added

- **kling-models.md "Character Consistency via start_image (v3.8.2+)" section** (~60 lines) — new empirical section with the 6-run comparison table (2 DreamActor runs preserving identity at 694x1242, 2 Kling mismatched-prompt runs morphing completely, 2 Kling matched-prompt runs preserving identity at 1072x1928), the prompt-matching rule, orchestrator guidance for multi-clip workflows, decision matrix for when to use DreamActor instead, and confirmation that non-human characters work (spike 5 Phase 2 test_11 robot mascot, user-confirmed).
- **CLAUDE.md key constraint** for start_image conditional identity lock — documents the prompt-matching rule, empirical evidence from session 19, DreamActor comparison data, and the finding that non-human characters are also supported.

### Changed

- **kling-models.md "Known limitations"** — character variation bullet updated from "adopt DreamActor" to "use start_image + matched prompt (see §Character Consistency)" as the primary recommendation.
- **kling-models.md "When NOT to use Kling"** — reference-image bullet updated to distinguish VEO's multi-reference-image feature from Kling's start_image character consistency.
- **Video SKILL.md Core Principle 5** — renamed to "Image-to-Video & Character Consistency"; added start_image + matched prompt guidance with pointer to kling-models.md.
- **Video SKILL.md Step 5 character consistency rule** — updated to include `--first-frame` guidance alongside the existing "repeat exact identity phrasing" rule.
- **ROADMAP.md** — DreamActor entry updated from v3.9.0 research release to "deferred to v3.9.x for real-footage-to-avatar niche."

### Research

- **Session 19 DreamActor + Kling start_image spike (8 runs, ~$1.10 total)**: 2 DreamActor M2.0 runs ($0.50) at $0.05/s (from replicate.com/bytedance/dreamactor-m2.0), 4 Kling start_image runs ($0.40), 2 Kling driving clips ($0.20). DreamActor preserves identity at 694x1242. Kling + matched prompt preserves identity at 1072x1928 — higher quality, lower cost, full prompt control. Kling + mismatched prompt morphs completely (proved prompt overrides start_image when they conflict). Spike artifacts at `/tmp/dreamactor-spike/`.

### Not in v3.8.2

- **DreamActor `/video animate-character` subcommand** — deferred to v3.9.x. The real-footage-to-avatar use case is valid but niche. Primary character consistency is handled by Kling start_image + matched prompt.
- **Kling v3 Omni** — supports dedicated reference images (up to 7) but deferred from spike 5 for 25+ min wall time.
- **Auto-resizing images to provider constraints** — face.jpg needed manual `sips -Z 1920` for DreamActor's bounds. A future helper would automate this.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-04-15

### Headline

**Fabric 1.0 `/video lipsync` + defensive hardening bundle.** v3.8.1 ships four follow-up items from v3.8.0's post-release triage: (1) a new `/video lipsync` subcommand backed by VEED Fabric 1.0 that pairs any face image with any audio file to produce a lip-synced talking-head MP4 — closing the v3.8.0 gap where VEO generated speech internally and Kling didn't accept external audio at all, so custom-designed ElevenLabs voices from `audio_pipeline.py narrate` had no way to reach a visible character; (2) User-Agent hardening on the image-gen Replicate scripts as a defensive fix for a Cloudflare WAF issue the video-side encountered in v3.8.0; (3) the user-requested Seedance 2.0 retest with the final verdict **permanently rejected for human-subject workflows** (E005 safety filter triggers on every human subject tested across two phases); (4) a new `smoke-test` subcommand on `_vertex_backend.py` that validates 3 spike 5 Phase 2 Vertex constraints without burning budget — after a first draft of that subcommand accidentally burned ~$3.60 submitting valid VEO requests that the spike had led me to believe would be rejected synchronously.

This release also documents a real behavior drift from spike 5 Phase 2: Vertex now ACCEPTS `durationSeconds=5` on VEO 3.1 Lite GA -001 models at submit time and validates asynchronously during generation, where spike 5 Phase 2 observed a synchronous rejection. Either the constraint has relaxed, or Vertex's validation topology changed. The `smoke-test` output surfaces this finding explicitly so future sessions don't re-hit the same billing trap.

### Added

- **`skills/video/scripts/video_lipsync.py`** (~260 lines) — new standalone runner for VEED Fabric 1.0. Argparse: `--image FACE --audio AUDIO [--resolution {480p,720p}] [--output DIR] [--replicate-key KEY] [--poll-interval N] [--max-wait N]`. Imports `_replicate_backend` for HTTP plumbing + auth + validation + data-URI encoding — zero duplicated Replicate logic. Poll loop, download, and save follow the exact pattern as `video_generate.py::_poll_replicate`. Pre-flight validation catches missing files, unsupported formats, and invalid resolutions before any API call. Output JSON on success mirrors `video_generate.py`'s shape: `{path, model, resolution, source_image, source_audio, generation_time_seconds, backend}`.
- **`skills/video/references/lipsync.md`** (~180 lines) — reference doc citing `dev-docs/veed-fabric-1.0-llms.md` as authoritative. Covers: why `/video lipsync` exists (closes the VEO external-audio gap), Fabric 1.0 capabilities table (480p/720p, 60s max, mp3/wav/m4a/aac, jpg/jpeg/png), canonical 2-step workflow (`audio_pipeline.py narrate` → `video_lipsync.py`), full ElevenLabs + Banana + Fabric showcase example, cost comparison vs Kling/VEO alternatives, known limitations (mouth region only, no camera movement, no emotional direction beyond audio prosody), and the design note explaining why Fabric is a separate script rather than a `--provider fabric` flag on `video_generate.py` (fundamentally different input shape — no prompt, no duration, no aspect ratio).
- **Fabric 1.0 helpers in `_replicate_backend.py`**: new `REPLICATE_MODELS["veed/fabric-1.0"]` registry entry, new `AUDIO_MIME_MAP` constant covering mp3/wav/m4a/aac, new `VALID_FABRIC_RESOLUTIONS` + `FABRIC_MAX_DURATION_S` + `MAX_FABRIC_AUDIO_BYTES` constants, new `audio_path_to_data_uri()` helper mirroring the existing `image_path_to_data_uri()` but for audio files, new `validate_fabric_params(image, audio, resolution)` validator enforcing the model card's 3 rules (resolution set membership, image extension set membership, audio extension set membership, both files exist), and new `build_fabric_request_body(image, audio, resolution)` pure function returning the canonical `{"input": {...}}` envelope.
- **10 new Fabric unit tests** at `/tmp/test_replicate_fabric.py` (kept in `/tmp` per the plugin's stdlib-only convention, not committed). Tests: `build_fabric_request_body` with explicit 720p + defaults + 480p + `{"input": ...}` envelope shape; `audio_path_to_data_uri` with mp3 → `"data:audio/mpeg;base64,..."` + wav → `"data:audio/wav;base64,..."` + unsupported `.ogg` raises + missing file raises; `validate_fabric_params` accepting png/mp3/720p + png/mp3/480p + rejecting 1080p + rejecting 4K + rejecting .webp image + rejecting .ogg audio + rejecting missing image + rejecting missing audio + accepting jpg/m4a alternate formats; plus a `REPLICATE_MODELS` registry regression check that Kling v3 Std is still registered alongside the new Fabric entry.
- **`smoke-test` subcommand on `_vertex_backend.py`** — sibling to the existing `diagnose` subcommand. Runs 3 FREE probes validating spike 5 Phase 2 Vertex constraints: (1) preview ID → HTTP 404 at URL resolution level, (2) invalid aspect ratio "1:1" → HTTP 400 at submit-validation level, (3) Gemini text-gen auth ping on the same credentials. Outputs a markdown PASS/FAIL/WARN report with exit codes 0/1/2. Designed to be safe to run repeatedly — any probe that can't be tested without charging is documented in the "untested constraints" section of the output instead of attempted.
- **`--seedance-only` flag on `spikes/v3.8.0-provider-bakeoff/phase2_run.py`** — v3.8.1 retest support. When set, overrides model selection to `[MODEL_SEEDANCE]` (just `bytedance/seedance-2.0`). Combine with `--tests test_id_1,test_id_2,...` to restrict the matrix. Supports the bounded 3-test retest plan from v3.8.0's NEXT_SESSION.md.
- **`MODEL_SEEDANCE = "seedance-2-0"` constant** + `EXTRA_REPLICATE_MODELS = [MODEL_SEEDANCE]` list + new dispatch branch in `execute_test_cell()` + new `execute_seedance_cell()` function + new `build_input_for_seedance()` helper in `phase2_run.py`. Seedance input dict mirrors Kling's but uses `image` (not `start_image`) for the first-frame field per the Seedance model card. `_project_cost()` updated to handle Seedance's per-call pricing (vs Kling/VEO's per-8s rates).
- **Seedance roster entry in `spikes/v3.8.0-provider-bakeoff/config/phase2_tests.json`** with `provider: "replicate"`, `replicate_id: "bytedance/seedance-2.0"`, full aspect support list, and `price_per_call_usd: 0.14`.

### Changed

- **`_replicate_backend.py::_cmd_diagnose` family-aware model listing**. The v3.8.0 version hardcoded `info["aspects"]` and `info["min_duration_s"]` field lookups that Kling has but Fabric doesn't. v3.8.1 branches on `info["family"]` and formats each family's row appropriately: Kling rows show `(min-max s, aspect_list)`, Fabric rows show `(lipsync, ≤60s, resolutions_list)`. Unknown families fall back to slug + display_name only. This change was required to make `_replicate_backend.py diagnose` not crash with KeyError after registering Fabric.
- **`skills/banana/scripts/replicate_generate.py`** — added `REPLICATE_USER_AGENT = "nano-banana-studio/3.8.1 (...)"` constant and `"User-Agent": REPLICATE_USER_AGENT` header in `_api_request()`. Defensive hardening against Cloudflare WAF error 1010 that could tighten on `/v1/models/.../predictions` endpoints. Deliberately duplicated from `_replicate_backend.py` rather than imported (no cross-skill sys.path gymnastics).
- **`skills/banana/scripts/replicate_edit.py`** — same User-Agent hardening applied. Both Replicate scripts now send the same User-Agent on every request.
- **`skills/video/SKILL.md`** — added `/video lipsync` to the Quick Reference table, annotated `/video extend` as "**DEPRECATED in v3.8.0**, requires `--acknowledge-veo-limitations`", added `references/lipsync.md` to the Reference Documentation list. Total: +3 lines. Size: still well under 500 lines.
- **`skills/video/references/kling-models.md`** — appended a "Seedance 2.0 retest outcome (v3.8.1)" section with the full 3-test results table, E005 filter pattern analysis, decision rationale, and pointers to the spike run directory with the failed `meta.json` files containing the error payloads.
- **`nano-banana-studio/CLAUDE.md`** — file responsibilities table gains `video_lipsync.py` and `lipsync.md` rows, `_replicate_backend.py` row updated to mention Fabric additions, `kling-models.md` row updated to mention the Seedance retest section. 6 new Key Constraints entries covering Fabric 1.0, Fabric parameter constraints, User-Agent hardening, Seedance retest verdict, Vertex smoke-test subcommand, and the empirical Vertex drift finding from spike 5 Phase 2.

### Fixed

- **`_replicate_backend.py::_cmd_diagnose` KeyError on Fabric entries** — fixed during Phase A by branching on `info["family"]` before accessing family-specific fields. Caught immediately because diagnose CLI is a standard Phase A verification step.
- **Spike-harness cost projection missing Seedance** — `_project_cost()` only iterated `CORE_MODELS + TIER_EXTRA_MODELS`, skipping `EXTRA_REPLICATE_MODELS` entirely. v3.8.1 adds the Seedance iteration with per-call pricing support. Caught by comparing the dry-run `projected_cost_usd` ($0.12 = anchors only) against the expected $0.54 (3 × $0.14 Seedance + $0.12 anchors).

### Research

- **Seedance 2.0 retest verdict: PERMANENTLY REJECTED for human-subject workflows.** v3.8.1 ran the user-requested retest with 3 diverse Phase 2 subjects (woman in home office, woman athlete, cartoon robot mascot) via the updated spike harness. Results: 2 of 3 FAILED with `E005 — input/output flagged as sensitive` on both human subjects (talking head AND athlete, both ~5-9 seconds to fail). Only the non-human cartoon robot mascot succeeded ($0.14, 123s wall). Combined with Phase 1's rejection on the bearded-man subject, the pattern is: **any human subject triggers the filter, non-human subjects pass**. For a plugin whose primary use cases involve human subjects, Seedance is not usable as a default, backup, or even tertiary provider. Documented in full in `references/kling-models.md` "Seedance 2.0 retest outcome (v3.8.1)" section. Retest spend: $0.14 (1 success) + $0.48 (12 anchor images regenerated for the retest matrix, ignoring the tests we didn't actually run). The spike's idempotent-skip logic + cost ledger reservation/release behavior correctly released the 2 failed cells' budget.

- **Vertex API behavior drift from spike 5 Phase 2**: during the v3.8.1 Vertex smoke-test development, Vertex ACCEPTED `durationSeconds=5` on VEO 3.1 Lite GA -001 and started the generation (burning budget), where spike 5 Phase 2 observed a synchronous HTTP 400 with `"supported durations are [8,4,6] for feature text_to_video"`. This is a real behavior change — either the duration constraint has relaxed on this Vertex project, or Google moved some parameter validation from synchronous (submit-time) to asynchronous (generation-time). v3.8.1's smoke test does NOT test duration to avoid burning budget, and the drift is documented in both `references/veo-models.md` and the smoke-test's "untested constraints" output. Future sessions should re-verify other spike 5 findings (preview-ID 404, aspect-ratio 400, Scene Ext v2 720p forcing) before relying on them for production workflows.

- **v3.8.1 smoke-test-design-bug cost audit**: the first draft of the Vertex `smoke-test` subcommand accidentally submitted 3 valid VEO requests to test model reachability (one preview ID → 404 correctly, two GA -001 IDs → both succeeded at submit time and started generation). Estimated worst-case overspend: ~$3.60 (Standard 8s = $3.20, Lite 8s = $0.40). The subcommand was immediately redesigned to only use probes that fail at URL resolution (404) or synchronous submit-validation (400), and the real runtime was re-verified with all 3 free probes PASSing at $0 additional cost. The incident is documented as a design pattern lesson: **smoke tests that send "minimal valid" requests are not safe** — always use intentionally-invalid probes whose rejection happens before billing.

### Not in v3.8.1

- **Seedance 2.0 as a tertiary plugin provider** — retest verdict was "permanently rejected for human workflows". Not wired into `_replicate_backend.py` model registry, not added to `video_generate.py --provider` choices, no `seedance-models.md` reference doc. Users who specifically need non-human workflows (brand mascots, animated characters) can call Seedance directly via Replicate's SDK.
- **Fabric + audio_pipeline.py tight coupling** — the two scripts are deliberately decoupled. Users chain them manually with the 2-step pattern. A future version could add a convenience `audio_pipeline.py lipsync --image FACE --text "..."` that auto-orchestrates narrate → Fabric, but that's out of scope for v3.8.1.
- **DreamActor M2.0 integration** for full-body character animation — still queued for potential v3.9.x research.
- **Upscaling post-Fabric** for 1080p/4K talking-head output — no current plugin path; Real-ESRGAN on Replicate is the candidate.
- **`video_extend.py` removal** — still deprecated + gated, not deleted, for backward compat.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-04-15

### Headline

**Kling v3 Std replaces VEO 3.1 as the default video model.** Spike 5 (94 video generations, ~$53 total spend across two phases) decisively proved Kling wins: 8 of 15 playback-verified shot types (VEO 3.1 Fast: 0 wins, 7 ties), 7.5× cheaper per 8s clip, 20× cheaper than VEO Standard, native 1:1 Instagram-square aspect ratio support (VEO does not support 1:1), and coherent 30-second narrative generation where VEO's extended workflow produces "glitches, inconsistent actors, audio seam discontinuities — horrible, do not use" (user verdict 2026-04-15). VEO remains callable as opt-in backup via `--provider veo --tier {lite|fast|standard}` with a warning to review against Kling output before committing to VEO for production. `video_extend.py` is hard-gated by a new `--acknowledge-veo-limitations` flag and exits with code 2 if the flag is absent.

This is a backend routing change, not a UX change: `/video generate`, `/video sequence`, and `/video extend` retain the same surface area. The only new CLI flags are `--provider {auto,kling,veo}`, `--tier {lite,fast,standard}`, and `--replicate-key`. The default model changes from `veo-3.1-generate-preview` to `kwaivgi/kling-v3-video`.

Full spike 5 findings: `spikes/v3.8.0-provider-bakeoff/writeup/v3.8.0-bakeoff-findings.md`.

### Added

- **`skills/video/scripts/_replicate_backend.py`** — pure data translation helper for Replicate predictions API, mirroring the `_vertex_backend.py` architecture. Exports: `build_kling_request_body`, `validate_kling_params`, `image_path_to_data_uri`, `parse_replicate_submit_response`, `parse_replicate_poll_response`, `build_predictions_url`, `load_replicate_credentials`, `replicate_post`, `replicate_get`. Error classes: `ReplicateBackendError`, `ReplicateValidationError`, `ReplicateAuthError`, `ReplicateSubmitError`, `ReplicatePollError`. Stdlib only. Includes `--diagnose` CLI that pings `/v1/account` to verify auth without burning a generation. Sends `User-Agent: nano-banana-studio/3.8.0 (...)` on every request to avoid Cloudflare WAF error 1010 on the account endpoint (observed during initial diagnose testing).
- **`skills/video/references/kling-models.md`** — new reference doc covering Kling v3 Std capabilities, spike 5 rationale for the default switch, pricing table ($0.16/8s pro, $0.30/15s pro, ~$0.60 for 30s via shot-list pipeline), `multi_prompt` JSON format with example, extended workflow guidance (use `video_sequence.py` shot-list pipeline), image-to-video constraints (10 MB start_image cap, 300 px minimum, 1:2.5-2.5:1 aspect range), wall time expectations (3-6 min per call), known limitations (English + Chinese audio only, character variation across separate generations). Authoritative source: `dev-docs/kwaivgi-kling-v3-video-llms.md`.
- **`--provider {auto,kling,veo}` flag** on `video_generate.py` — resolves to a concrete `--model` slug if `--model` is not explicitly set. `auto` defaults to Kling; `kling` forces Kling; `veo` forces VEO with `--tier {lite,fast,standard}` (default: lite).
- **`--tier {lite,fast,standard}` flag** on `video_generate.py` — VEO tier selector, only consulted when `--provider veo`. Defaults to `lite` per spike 5 Phase 2B finding that Fast and Standard tier premiums are imperceptible at 1 fps sampling.
- **`--replicate-key` flag** on `video_generate.py` — overrides the Replicate API token, else loads from `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` env var or `~/.banana/config.json` `replicate_api_token` field (same field used by the image-gen side via `setup_mcp.py`).
- **`--acknowledge-veo-limitations` flag** on `video_extend.py` — **required**. Without this flag, the script exits with code 2 and prints a deprecation message pointing users at `video_sequence.py` with the Kling shot-list pipeline. Hard-gate prevents accidental VEO extended usage given the spike 5 "horrible, do not use" verdict.
- **`BACKEND_REPLICATE` constant** + routing branch in `_select_backend()` — model slugs containing `/` (owner/name format) route to Replicate with highest priority, before any other rule.
- **`MODELS_REPLICATE` registry** in `video_generate.py` listing the Replicate model slugs (v3.8.0 ships with one: `kwaivgi/kling-v3-video`).
- **`_submit_replicate()`, `_poll_replicate()`, `_save_video_replicate()` functions** in `video_generate.py` — per-backend implementations following the same pattern as the existing `_vertex_ai` functions. The submit function translates VEO-shaped kwargs (resolution → mode, first_frame → start_image data URI, etc.) and blocks unsupported VEO-only features (`--reference-image`, `--video-input`).
- **`veo-backup` quality tier** in `video_sequence.py` — opt-in VEO 3.1 Lite path for the sequence pipeline. All other tiers (draft, fast, standard, premium, lite, legacy) now route to Kling v3 Std.
- **Kling entries in `VALID_DURATIONS_BY_MODEL` and `VALID_RATIOS_BY_MODEL`** — Kling accepts any integer in [3, 15] seconds and supports 16:9 / 9:16 / **1:1** aspect ratios. The empty-dict default keeps VEO at its existing `{4, 6, 8}` duration set and `{16:9, 9:16}` aspect set.

### Changed

- **`DEFAULT_MODEL` in `video_generate.py`** changed from `"veo-3.1-generate-preview"` to `"kwaivgi/kling-v3-video"`. Explicit `--model` overrides still work; `--provider auto` resolves to the new default when `--model` is unset.
- **`DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MODEL` in `video_sequence.py`** changed from `"veo-3.1-generate-preview"` to `"kwaivgi/kling-v3-video"`.
- **`QUALITY_TIER_MODELS` remapped in `video_sequence.py`** — draft, fast, standard, premium, lite, and legacy all point to `kwaivgi/kling-v3-video`. Kling's $0.16/8s pricing is cheap enough to serve as both draft and premium tiers — no point in the v3.6.x 5-tier VEO ladder when Kling quality is already equivalent to VEO Standard at 20× lower cost. Aliases (`lite`, `legacy`) preserved for backward compat but point to Kling, not VEO. New `veo-backup` tier provides explicit VEO opt-in.
- **`_veo_cost()` in `video_sequence.py`** dispatches on model slug shape: slugs with `/` look up `_KLING_PER_SECOND` (Kling at ~$0.02/s pro mode); plain IDs look up `_VEO_PER_SECOND` (unchanged). Returns None for unknown models so callers can treat unknown as opaque.
- **`MODELS_WITHOUT_4K` now includes Kling** (`kwaivgi/kling-v3-video`) — Kling maxes at 1080p pro mode. The error message is Kling-aware: instructs users to use `--resolution 1080p` for Kling, or explicitly `--provider veo` if they need 4K (VEO Fast/Standard preview IDs only).
- **`skills/video/SKILL.md` orchestrator** updated to default to Kling for `/video generate` and `/video sequence`. Added Kling-specific guidance: 3-6 minute wall time expectation, aspect_ratio + start_image mutual exclusion caveat, English + Chinese audio limitation. Added explicit VEO warning for when users request VEO backup. Updated Model Routing table with Kling as the default row. Core Principle 2 generalized from "VEO 3.1 generates audio" to "both Kling and VEO generate audio".
- **`skills/video/references/veo-models.md`** prepended with "v3.8.0 status: BACKUP ONLY" section containing the spike 5 scoreboard, cost ratios, and the 5 Vertex API constraints discovered in Phase 2 (preview ID restrictions, Scene Ext v2 720p forcing, 15 MB inline upload limit, duration {4,6,8} only, aspect {16:9, 9:16} only). Added the Lite/Fast/Standard tier comparison table from spike 5 Phase 2B.
- **`nano-banana-studio/CLAUDE.md` file responsibilities table** updated with `_replicate_backend.py` and `kling-models.md` entries. Added 10+ new Key Constraints entries covering the v3.8.0 default change, Kling parameter rules, English+Chinese audio limitation, aspect+start_image mutual exclusion, Cloudflare User-Agent requirement, `Prefer: wait=0` non-compliance, `aborted` status enum handling, and the `video_extend.py` deprecation gate rationale.

### Deprecated

- **`video_extend.py`** — hard-gated by `--acknowledge-veo-limitations` flag as of v3.8.0. Running without the flag exits with code 2 and a JSON deprecation message. Kept in the codebase for backward compat and for users who explicitly want VEO extended output after reviewing the spike 5 findings.

### Fixed

- **Replicate API `/v1/account` endpoint blocked by Cloudflare WAF error 1010** when using Python-urllib's default User-Agent. `_replicate_backend.py` sends a custom `User-Agent: nano-banana-studio/3.8.0 (+https://github.com/juliandickie/creators-studio)` header on every request. The existing image-gen `replicate_generate.py` does NOT set a User-Agent and works only because `/v1/models/.../predictions` endpoints have more lenient Cloudflare rules — adding User-Agent to that script is a candidate v3.8.x hardening but out of scope for this release.
- **Replicate Prediction.status `aborted` not handled by the spike's client** — the OpenAPI schema explicitly defines 6 status values (`starting | processing | succeeded | failed | canceled | aborted`) but `spikes/v3.8.0-provider-bakeoff/lib/replicate_client.py` only handles the first 5. `_replicate_backend.parse_replicate_poll_response()` maps `aborted` to the "failed" bucket — without this fix, the poll loop would spin forever on aborted predictions.
- **Spike's `Prefer: wait=0` is non-spec-compliant per the Replicate OpenAPI regex** (`^wait(=([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|60))?$`). `_replicate_backend.py` omits the Prefer header entirely for async-first semantic, which is correct for Kling's 3-6 min wall times.
- **4K error message in `video_generate.py` was hardcoded to VEO-only guidance** — used to say "Use 'veo-3.1-generate-preview' or 'veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview' for 4K" regardless of which model was blocked. Now model-aware: Kling users see "Kling v3 Std maxes at 1080p (pro mode). Use --resolution 1080p or --provider veo if you specifically need 4K output."

### Deferred to v3.8.x / later

- **Kling chain helper** — spike's `extended_run.py` proved the last-frame-chaining pattern works for single-continuous-long-shot workflows, but the existing `video_sequence.py` shot-list pipeline already handles extended workflows via independent Kling calls per shot. A dedicated chain helper is deferred until a specific single-continuous-30s use case emerges.
- **Seedance 2.0 retest** — rejected in spike 5 Phase 1 due to E005 safety filter on all 4 attempts with the bearded-man subject. Phase 2 uses different subjects, so a retest with Phase 2 shot definitions could succeed. Queued as v3.8.x ROADMAP priority 10a. Estimated spend: $2-3.
- **Kling v3 Omni** — deferred from spike 5 Phase 1 for 25+ minute wall time on multi_prompt + refs config. Revisit only if Replicate optimizes this below 5 min.
- **PrunaAI P-Video** — tested in spike 5 Phase 1 as a potential "draft tier" at $0.04/13s wall time, but user declined to wire it in v3.8.0 after reviewing the Phase 1 output. Kling at $0.16/clip serves the iteration-loop use case well enough.
- **`_vertex_smoke_test.py`** — pre-flight check script for the 5 Vertex API constraints discovered in Phase 2 (preview ID restrictions, Scene Ext v2 720p forcing, 15 MB inline limit, duration {4,6,8}, aspect {16:9, 9:16}). Put it in `skills/video/scripts/` next to `_vertex_backend.py`. Queued as ROADMAP priority 10b.
- **Adding User-Agent to `skills/banana/scripts/replicate_generate.py`** — defensive hardening to future-proof the image-gen path if Cloudflare tightens the `/v1/models/.../predictions` rules. Low priority given the image-gen path currently works without it.

## [3.7.4] - 2026-04-15

### Headline

**Audio polish + voice cloning bundle.** Five changes close the v3.7.1/v3.7.2 polish debt before the v3.8.0 provider-abstraction work starts: real stereo FFmpeg mix (the v3.7.1 narration was mono-in-stereo-container on headphones, fixed with `pan=stereo|c0=c0|c1=c0` + explicit `-ac 2`), ElevenLabs Instant Voice Cloning via a new `voice-clone` subcommand (30+ seconds of audio → permanent `custom_voices.{role}` entry with `source_type=cloned`), auto-measured per-voice WPM persisted to `custom_voices.{role}.wpm` on promote/clone/retroactive-measure, multi-call Lyria with FFmpeg `acrossfade` for music longer than the 32.768s hard cap (auto-routed when `length_ms > 32768` and `source=lyria`), and shared client-side stripping of named copyrighted creators from both Lyria and ElevenLabs Music prompts (20+ triggers — photographers, publications, composers, broadcasters, pop artists — with `--allow-creators` bypass).

Pure documentation-plus-polish release on top of the v3.7.x audio foundation. No new external dependencies, no breaking changes, no API calls during build (just a syntax + help + status smoke test — `py_compile` clean, all 11 subcommands registered, status passes all 6 checks).

### Added

- **`voice-clone` subcommand** wrapping ElevenLabs IVC (`POST /v1/voices/add`). Accepts a single audio file OR a directory of audio files (`--audio`) and uploads them together as multipart/form-data via a new `_http_post_multipart()` stdlib helper. CLI surface: `--name`, `--role`, `--description`, `--label-{language,accent,gender,age}`, `--remove-background-noise`, `--notes`, `--no-auto-wpm`, `--api-key`. Supported input formats: mp3, wav, m4a, flac, ogg, opus, aiff, webm. Persists to `custom_voices.{role}` with `source_type=cloned`, `design_method=ivc`, plus `source_audio_count` / `source_audio_total_bytes` / `source_audio_total_duration_sec` / `requires_verification` / `labels`.
- **`voice-measure` subcommand** for retroactively measuring WPM on voices that pre-date v3.7.4. Runs the same 38-word reference phrase → duration probe → WPM calculation as the auto-measure path, persists to `custom_voices.{role}.wpm` + `.wpm_measured_at`.
- **`generate_music_lyria_extended()` function** — multi-call Lyria with FFmpeg acrossfade for music durations longer than 32.768s. Computes N = `ceil((target - crossfade) / (32.768 - crossfade))`, generates N clips via `generate_music_lyria()`, chains them with equal-power `acrossfade=d=2:c1=tri:c2=tri`, trims to exact target duration, transcodes to MP3 at the requested bitrate. Result dict includes `clip_count`, `cost_usd_estimate`, `crossfade_sec`. Auto-routed by `generate_music()` when `source=lyria` and `length_ms > 32768 + 500ms` grace.
- **`strip_named_creators()` helper + `NAMED_CREATOR_TRIGGERS` list** (20+ entries: Annie Leibovitz, Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams, Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton, Steve McCurry, Vanity Fair, National Geographic, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, WIRED, Wallpaper*, Architectural Digest, Bon Appetit, Kinfolk, Rolling Stone, BBC Earth, BBC, Pixar, Disney, Netflix, HBO, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Ennio Morricone, Ludovico Einaudi, Max Richter, Philip Glass, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Drake, Kanye, The Beatles). Case-insensitive substring match with longer-phrase precedence and whitespace normalisation. Called on both `generate_music_lyria()` and `generate_music_elevenlabs()` entry points so both providers behave consistently.
- **`_http_post_multipart()` stdlib helper** for `multipart/form-data` file uploads. Constructs the body by hand with a UUID-based boundary, supports multiple file parts sharing the same form field name (ElevenLabs IVC expects multiple `files` parts in one request). Used by `clone_voice()`; reusable for future multipart endpoints.
- **`_collect_audio_files()` helper** that resolves the `--audio` argument to a list of Path objects — accepts a single file or a directory, filters directories to audio extensions, errors if no files found.
- **`measure_voice_wpm()` function** generating a 38-word neutral reference phrase via `generate_narration()`, probing duration with ffprobe, returning `word_count / (duration_sec / 60)`. Cost: one TTS call (~fraction of a cent on subscription tiers). Persists to `custom_voices.{role}.wpm` on voice-promote and voice-clone.
- **`voice_measure()` function** — CLI entry point for retroactive WPM measurement on existing voices.
- **`--allow-creators` flag** on both `music` and `pipeline` subcommands. Bypasses the client-side named-creator strip when users want to test whether the upstream filter has relaxed for a specific term or when they hit a false positive (e.g. "Drake" in a duck-themed prompt).
- **`stripped_terms` field** in the `generate_music_lyria()` and `generate_music_elevenlabs()` result dicts — a list of triggers removed by the pre-flight strip (empty if none matched).
- **`source_audio_total_duration_sec` sanity check** in `clone_voice()` that warns (but does not block) when total audio is under 25 seconds — ElevenLabs documents 30s as the minimum, and the upstream API is the authoritative rejection.
- **`voice-clone` / `voice-measure` / `voice-clone` sections** in `skills/video/references/audio-pipeline.md` documenting the new subcommands, the strip behaviour, the WPM calibration model, IVC vs PVC delta (PVC deferred to v3.7.5+), voice captcha verification flow, and the consent caveat.

### Changed

- **`SIDECHAIN_FILTER` in `audio_pipeline.py` rewritten** to use `aformat=channel_layouts=mono,pan=stereo|c0=c0|c1=c0` on the narration branch, explicitly duplicating the mono ElevenLabs TTS source onto both L+R channels before `apad` and `sidechaincompress`. The v3.7.1 `aformat=channel_layouts=stereo` alone declared stereo metadata but did not upmix the actual signal — the result was "stereo in container, silent right channel" that presented as speaker-left-only narration on headphones. The `mix_narration_with_music()` ffmpeg invocation also gains `-ac 2` to lock the output container channel count.
- **`generate_music()` dispatcher** auto-routes to `generate_music_lyria_extended()` when `source="lyria"` and requested length exceeds 32.768s (with a 500ms grace). Single-call Lyria path preserved for efficiency when the duration fits in one clip.
- **`promote_voice()` now auto-measures WPM** immediately after promoting a designed voice. Non-fatal if measurement fails — the voice is persisted with base metadata first, WPM is patched in a second atomic write. User can retry via `voice-measure --role ROLE`.
- **`clone_voice()` auto-measures WPM** on successful clone (skipped when `requires_verification=true` is returned, since the voice isn't usable until captcha completion). Disable with `--no-auto-wpm`.
- **`skills/video/references/audio-pipeline.md`** header bumped to "v3.7.1 + v3.7.2 + v3.7.4" with a 5-item summary of the v3.7.4 changes at the top. Existing "Banned content" and "TOS guardrails" sections updated to reference the new client-side strip. New sections for voice cloning and WPM measurement.
- **`pipeline()` Python function signature** gained `allow_creators: bool = False` parameter, passed through to `generate_music()` for the music generation stage.

### Fixed

- **Mono narration on headphones** (v3.7.1 regression): the sidechain mix declared stereo but the signal was mono-on-left-only. Users reported narration "coming from the left speaker" on headphones. Root cause was `aformat=channel_layouts=stereo` acting as metadata-only declaration rather than an actual upmix — verified by reading the FFmpeg filter documentation after the bug was noticed in spike 3 session notes. `pan=stereo|c0=c0|c1=c0` is the canonical mono-to-stereo upmix filter and produces real two-channel audio.

### Deferred to later v3.7.x / v3.8.0

- **Professional Voice Cloning (PVC)** — separate `/v1/voices/pvc/*` endpoint family, requires 30+ minutes of audio, Creator+ plan, multi-step fine-tuning workflow. Reserved as `design_method="pvc"` under the existing `source_type="cloned"` enum. Targets v3.7.5+.
- **Lyria long-music cost warning** — when `generate_music_lyria_extended` would issue more than 5 calls (~$0.30 per request), emit a pre-flight confirmation prompt or require a `--confirm-extended-cost` flag. Not implemented in v3.7.4; the `cost_usd_estimate` field in the result is the only signal.
- **Stripping of "in the style of X" compound phrases** — current behaviour leaves `"in the style of , warm strings"` after stripping X. The providers ignore the dangling phrase, but a future polish pass could match the containing `in the style of NAME` pattern as a unit. Tracked as a small polish item.
- **Strip-list extensibility** — the `NAMED_CREATOR_TRIGGERS` list is hardcoded. A future release could move it to `~/.banana/config.json` so users can add their own terms without editing the script.
- Spike 5 (character-consistency bake-off) still deferred to v3.8.0 planning.

## [3.7.3] - 2026-04-15

### Headline

**Spike 6 ships — prompt-engineering guidance refreshed against Gemini 3.1 and Google's official prompting docs.** Two pieces of v3.6.x guidance turned out to be wrong:

1. The "banned keywords" rule (`"8K"`, `"masterpiece"`, `"ultra-realistic"`, `"high resolution"`) was based on older model behaviour. Spike 6 tested it on `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` with a 9-image matrix (3 conditions × 3 samples, $0.70). Result: file-size variance *within* conditions (213 KB) exceeded variance *between* conditions (66 KB). Visual quality was indistinguishable with or without the modifiers. The rule is obsolete — the keywords are useless, not harmful.
2. The replacement "use prestigious context anchors" rule (`"Vanity Fair editorial portrait"`, `"National Geographic cover story"`, `"Wallpaper* design editorial"`) is actively harmful. The same spike 6 test included `"Annie Leibovitz editorial portrait, Vanity Fair magazine cover style, dramatic studio lighting"` — all 3 samples rendered as **literal magazine covers** with masthead typography (`"VAVANITY FAIR"`), headline text overlays, cover-line gibberish, and magazine-layout framing. Gemini 3.1's text-rendering strength works against you here: it's *good enough* at rendering "Vanity Fair" that when you name it, you get Vanity Fair.

The authoritative replacement is Google's official Gemini 3.1 Flash Image prompting guide, which leads with: *"Describe the scene, don't just list keywords. The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words."*

### Added

- **New "Core Principle (Gemini 3.1)" lede** at the top of `references/prompt-engineering.md` with Google's "describe the scene, don't just list keywords" quote and four corollaries (prose > tags, context > ornament, iterate > one-shot, semantic > negative).
- **"Prompt Patterns That Don't Help (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image)" section** replacing the old "BANNED PROMPT KEYWORDS" section. Documents spike 6 findings with `<!-- verified: 2026-04-15 -->`, a 5-row replacement table for common publication-name anchors (each showing the failing prompt and the direct-description equivalent), and worked ❌/✅ examples for keyword-stuffing remediation.
- **"Google's Official Use-Case Templates (Gemini 3.1)" section** with seven templates lifted verbatim from `ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation`: photorealistic scene, stylised illustration/sticker, accurate text in image, product mockup, minimalist/negative-space composition, sequential art/comic panel, and grounded-in-a-reference-image. Plus Google's 6-point best-practice checklist (hyper-specific, context/intent, iterate, step-by-step, semantic negative, camera-control language).
- **New `Gemini 3.1 Prompt Guidance Refresh (v3.7.3)` subsection** in README "What's New" summarising the two corrections and pointing to the updated reference doc.

### Changed

- **`references/prompt-engineering.md` → Component 5 (STYLE)** rewrote the "Good" example to describe Dorothea Lange's register via direct composition/light description rather than citing a publication, and added an "Also bad" example flagging `"Vanity Fair magazine cover style"` as a documented failure mode.
- **`references/prompt-engineering.md` → Editorial/Fashion Mode** replaced the `Vogue Italia, Harper's Bazaar, GQ, National Geographic, Kinfolk` "Publication refs" line with a "Visual register (describe directly, do NOT name magazines)" line listing compositional descriptors (high-contrast studio editorial, natural-light documentary fashion, etc.).
- **`references/prompt-engineering.md` → Prompt Templates section** scrubbed magazine-name anchors from the five affected examples (Instagram Ad, National Geographic fitness ad, Bon Appetit beverage ad, Bon Appetit food ad, Wallpaper* bottle branding). Each replacement describes the visual register directly.
- **`references/prompt-engineering.md` → Prompt Adaptation Rules table** the `8K, masterpiece, ultra-detailed → use prestigious anchors` row was rewritten to cut the modifiers without replacement (the old advice pointed users into the publication-name failure mode).
- **`references/prompt-engineering.md` → Common Prompt Mistakes #1 + Key Tactics #9** rewritten to reflect the new rule: describe register directly, do not substitute magazine names. Cameras, lenses, lighting, and composition remain safe and productive.
- **`references/prompt-engineering.md` → Product/Commercial + Logo/Branding "Pattern" lines** updated to end in `[direct visual-register description — NOT a magazine name]` instead of `[prestigious publication reference]`.
- **`CLAUDE.md` → Key constraints** the legacy "NEVER use banned keywords" bullet is replaced by three bullets: (1) the core "describe the scene" principle, (2) the publication-format warning with the spike 6 citation, and (3) a note that the old banned-keywords list is useless-but-not-harmful on Gemini 3.1.

### Spike 6 results (full)

| Condition | Prompt fragment | Avg file size (KB) | Avg gen time (s) | Visual outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A — banned keywords | `"8K ultra-realistic masterpiece high resolution portrait of..."` | 3015 | 25.5 | Clean portrait, no quality difference from B |
| B — neutral baseline | `"portrait of..."` (no quality modifiers) | 3055 | 26.5 | Clean portrait, baseline reference |
| C — prestigious anchor | `"Annie Leibovitz editorial portrait, Vanity Fair magazine cover style..."` | 2989 | 25.4 | All 3 samples rendered as literal magazine covers with masthead + headline text overlays |

File-size variance within each condition (≤ 213 KB) exceeded between-condition variance (66 KB), confirming that the "banned" modifiers are statistically indistinguishable from baseline on Gemini 3.1. Total spike 6 cost: $0.70. Cumulative session spend across all strategic-reset spikes: ~$5.53.

### Deferred to later v3.7.x / v3.8.0

- Spike 5 (character-consistency bake-off: VEO vs Kling vs Runway, ~$15-20) still deferred to v3.8.0 planning.
- Automated regression eval for prompt-engineering claims — still targeted at v3.8.1 after the v3.8.0 provider abstraction lands.
- Lyria-vs-ElevenLabs genre bake-off, multi-call Lyria for long music, stereo FFmpeg mix, auto-measured per-voice WPM, voice cloning — unchanged from v3.7.2.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-04-14

### Headline

**Lyria 2 added as the new default music source after a 5-way bake-off.** Spike 4 of the strategic reset session tested 5 music providers with the identical "cinematic nature documentary" prompt: Google Lyria 2, ElevenLabs Music, Meta MusicGen (`stereo-large`), MiniMax Music 1.5, and Stability AI Stable Audio 2.5. **Lyria won decisively** with ElevenLabs as a close second; MusicGen was middle-of-the-pack despite being 2 years old; MiniMax (a song-generation model) was rated worse than MusicGen because it fought instrumental prompts; Stable Audio was rated worst despite having the strongest spec sheet. v3.7.2 ships Lyria as the new default and retains ElevenLabs as the alternative; the other 3 are NOT integrated.

### The most important finding from spike 4

**F13 (audio gen quality is uncorrelated with spec-sheet metrics).** Stable Audio 2.5 had the fastest generation (4.6s vs Lyria's 26s), competitive sample rate (44.1 kHz), and the cleanest diffusion architecture, but the user heard it as the worst of the 5. Conversely, MusicGen (the 2-year-old open-source baseline) beat the much newer MiniMax 1.5 because MusicGen was trained on instrumental music while MiniMax was trained on songs with vocals. **Domain of training matters more than recency or spec sheets.** This belongs in `references/video-audio.md` as F13 with a `<!-- verified: 2026-04-14 -->` marker, and the generalizable principle is captured in CLAUDE.md key constraints: always evaluate new audio providers via subjective listening, never via benchmarks.

### Added

- **Google Lyria 2 (`lyria-002`) as the default music source** in `audio_pipeline.py`. Reuses the existing `vertex_api_key` + `vertex_project_id` + `vertex_location` from VEO setup — no new credentials needed. Outputs 32.768 second 48kHz/192kbps stereo MP3 (transcoded by the script from base64 WAV in the API response). Cost: $0.06 per call.
- **`generate_music_lyria()` function** in `audio_pipeline.py` with full Lyria 2 API support including the `negative_prompt` field that ElevenLabs Music doesn't have. Empirically validated by spike 4 + a follow-up smoke test through the new Python wrapper.
- **`generate_music()` dispatcher function** that routes to either Lyria or ElevenLabs based on a `source` parameter (default `"lyria"`). Both providers remain first-class.
- **`--music-source {lyria,elevenlabs}` CLI flag** on both the `pipeline` and `music` subcommands. Default is `lyria`.
- **`--music-negative-prompt` CLI flag** on the `pipeline` subcommand for Lyria's negative-exclusion feature. Lyria honors it cleanly; ElevenLabs ignores it.
- **`vertex/lyria-002` pricing row** in `cost_tracker.py` with the fixed $0.06/call rate and a comment explaining the per-clip vs per-second billing model and the spike 4 5-way bake-off context.
- **F13 finding** in `references/video-audio.md` documenting the spec-vs-quality decoupling discovered in spike 4. Each music model's empirical ranking is captured with the generalizable principles for future model evaluations.
- **"Music sources (v3.7.2 multi-provider)" section** in `references/audio-pipeline.md` with the full provider comparison table (Lyria vs ElevenLabs across audio quality, duration, negative prompt support, cost, generation time, etc.), the 5-way bake-off results table, the "when to use which" decision matrix, the Lyria-specific prompt engineering tips, and the API-key auth caveat (Lyria's docs only document OAuth but spike 4 confirmed API-key auth works — same pattern as VEO).
- **Updated architecture diagram** in `references/audio-pipeline.md` showing the new multi-provider music branch (Lyria default, ElevenLabs alternative).

### Changed

- **Renamed `skills/video/scripts/elevenlabs_audio.py` → `skills/video/scripts/audio_pipeline.py`** via `git mv` (preserves blame history). The file was named after a single provider (ElevenLabs) when it shipped in v3.7.1 yesterday, but now serves multiple music providers — the v3.7.1 name is misleading post-Lyria-integration. 12-hour-old script, no external consumers, clean rename with no migration cost.
- **Renamed `skills/video/references/elevenlabs-audio.md` → `skills/video/references/audio-pipeline.md`** for the same reason. All cross-references in `video-audio.md`, SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, and PROGRESS.md updated.
- **Default music source for the audio pipeline is now Lyria 2** (was ElevenLabs Music in v3.7.1). The `pipeline` subcommand uses Lyria by default. Users who want ElevenLabs explicitly pass `--music-source elevenlabs`.
- **`pipeline()` Python function signature** gained `music_source` and `music_negative_prompt` parameters with sensible defaults. Backward compat: existing v3.7.1 usage via the renamed script still works because the new parameters have defaults.
- **`status` subcommand now reports both music providers** — Lyria/Vertex credentials check + ElevenLabs key check + ffmpeg/ffprobe + custom voice library. Previously only checked ElevenLabs.
- **`mix_narration_with_music` is now called with the actual probed music duration** rather than the requested `music_length_ms`. This was a latent bug in v3.7.1: if ElevenLabs returned a slightly off-target duration, the apad would be wrong. With Lyria's fixed 32.768s clip ignoring `music_length_ms` entirely, the bug would have surfaced as a 768ms music-tail truncation. Now fixed.
- **`audio-pipeline.md` "Prompt engineering" section restructured** to cover both providers together, with a Lyria-specific subsection on negative prompts (the killer feature vs ElevenLabs) and a shared subsection on the named-creator TOS rule that applies to both providers.

### Spike 4 five-way bake-off results (full table)

| Rank | Provider | Listening verdict | Tech specs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🥇 1st | **Lyria 2** | "Definitely awesome", noticeable stereo on headphones, ship-ready | 48kHz / 192kbps stereo, 32.768s, $0.06/call |
| 🥈 2nd | **ElevenLabs Music** | Close second, very similar quality to Lyria | 44.1kHz / 128kbps stereo, configurable, subscription |
| 🥉 3rd | Meta MusicGen `stereo-large` | Average, no vocal artifacts, slight volume fluctuations | 32kHz / 96kbps stereo, March 2024 model |
| 4th | MiniMax Music 1.5 | Worse than MusicGen despite being newer (Nov 2025) | 44.1kHz / 256kbps stereo, song model fighting instrumental prompts |
| 5th | Stability AI Stable Audio 2.5 | Worst per listening test, despite strongest spec sheet | 44.1kHz / 128kbps stereo, fastest generation (4.6s vs Lyria's 26s), Nov 2025 |

Total spike 4 cost: ~$0.30 (Lyria $0.06 × 2 spike calls + Eleven $0 subscription + MusicGen ~$0.12 + MiniMax ~$0.20 + Stable Audio ~$0.05). Cumulative session spend across all spikes (1+2+3+4): ~$4.83. Approved budget remaining: ~$15-20 for spike 6 (banned-keywords re-validation, deferred to v3.7.3).

### Deferred to v3.7.3+

- **Spike 6 — banned-keywords re-validation** ($1.50). Originally part of the v3.7.2 plan but deferred to keep this release focused on Lyria. Targets v3.7.3.
- **Multi-call Lyria for longer music** (auto-loop calls when `--music-length-ms > 32768`). Currently Lyria has a hard 32.768s cap; users needing longer music must use `--music-source elevenlabs`.
- **Lyria-vs-ElevenLabs genre bake-off** (user request from v3.7.2 listening session). Test both providers across electronic, classical, folk, ambient, jazz, and hip-hop genres to surface model-strength differences beyond the cinematic-orchestral case validated in spike 4. Targets a v3.7.x research release.
- **Stereo output in FFmpeg mix** (still mono — known v3.7.1 polish issue).
- **Auto-measured per-voice WPM** (still hardcoded — known v3.7.1 polish issue).
- **Voice cloning** (Instant Voice Clone, Professional Voice Clone — schema field reserved).

### Verification

- **Smoke-tested the new `audio_pipeline.py music --source lyria` command** end-to-end. Returned structured JSON with `source: "lyria"`, `model_id: "lyria-002"`, `duration_seconds: 32.768`, `elapsed_seconds: 25.13`, and a 788KB MP3 (transcoded from 6.29MB WAV). Identical output characteristics to the spike 4 raw API call — the new Python wrapper produces no regression vs the spike script.
- **Lyria authentication via Vertex API key confirmed working** through the `audio_pipeline.py` code path. Same `vertex_api_key` from `~/.banana/config.json` that the existing VEO calls use. No new credentials needed.
- **`audio_pipeline.py --help` and all subcommand `--help` outputs verified** — `music` subcommand correctly shows `--source {lyria,elevenlabs}`, `pipeline` subcommand correctly shows `--music-source {lyria,elevenlabs}` and `--music-negative-prompt`.
- **`git mv` preserved file history** for both renamed files — `git status --short` shows them as `R` (renamed), not `D` (deleted) + `??` (added).
- **Version consistency verified**: `3.7.2` appears in `plugin.json`, `README.md` badge, and `CITATION.cff` (date `2026-04-14`).
- **No new pip dependencies.** Lyria integration uses stdlib `urllib.request` + `base64` + `subprocess` for ffmpeg transcoding. Matches the plugin's existing fallback-script pattern.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-04-14

### Headline

**ElevenLabs audio replacement pipeline + custom voice design + strategic reset.** v3.7.1 ships the first non-VEO audio capability after a deep strategic reset session that questioned the entire v3.7.0 plan. Three empirical spike rounds invalidated the original "voice-changer post-pass" assumption, surfaced the real multi-clip music-bed seam problem, and validated a structural audio replacement architecture (continuous TTS + Eleven Music + FFmpeg ducked mix + lossless audio swap) end-to-end. The new `elevenlabs_audio.py` script + `references/elevenlabs-audio.md` ship as the canonical solution. Custom voice design via ElevenLabs Voice Design API is also wired in, with a nested `custom_voices.{role}` config schema designed for the multi-voice future already on the roadmap.

### Strategic reset session — what changed

The session was a deliberate "stop building, look up" checkpoint after 5 releases shipped in 48 hours. Three findings reshaped v3.7.0/v3.7.1:

1. **VEO 3.1 generates voiceover narration natively** via `"A narrator says, '...'"` — confirmed by Google's own Vertex AI prompt guide and verified empirically. The original v3.7.0 ROADMAP claim that VEO "doesn't generate voiceover; it's added in post" was wrong. The TTS subcommand originally scoped for v3.7.0 was solving a non-problem.
2. **VEO does NOT have voice character drift across separately-generated clips** when descriptors are locked. Spike 2 generated 4 clips of the same scene with the same voice descriptor and the user verified perfect voice consistency. The original v3.7.1 voice-changer scope was based on a false assumption.
3. **The real "multi-clip drift" problem is musical, not vocal**: each VEO clip generates its own emergent music intro/outro envelope independently, so stitched sequences have audible music seams every clip-duration. Spike 3 confirmed the fix is structural audio replacement, not voice changing.

The session also discovered Replicate's official MCP server (npm `replicate-mcp`), Vertex AI Model Garden's 200+ models including Lyria for music generation, and that Google ADK is architecturally incompatible with Claude Code's skill runtime (don't adopt). All of these are documented in the strategic reset plan and inform v3.7.2+ scope.

### Added

- **`skills/video/scripts/elevenlabs_audio.py`** — new ~720 line stdlib-only Python script implementing the v3.7.1 audio replacement pipeline. Subcommands:
  - `pipeline` — canonical end-to-end command. Parallel TTS + Eleven Music API calls, FFmpeg sidechain mix, lossless audio swap into video. Halves user-perceived latency by parallelizing the two API calls.
  - `narrate`, `music`, `mix`, `swap` — individual stage commands for debugging or partial workflows
  - `voice-design` — POST `/v1/text-to-voice/design` to generate 3 candidate voice previews from a text description (eleven_ttv_v3 model)
  - `voice-promote` — POST `/v1/text-to-voice` to save a chosen preview as a permanent custom voice, atomically write to `~/.banana/config.json` under the new `custom_voices.{role}` schema
  - `voice-list` — list custom voices from config
  - `status` — verify ElevenLabs API key + ffmpeg + custom voices
- **`skills/video/references/elevenlabs-audio.md`** — comprehensive new reference doc covering the v3.7.1 architecture (TTS + music + ducked mix + audio swap), voice management (design → promote → use), prompt engineering for both TTS narration and Eleven Music, FFmpeg parameter rationale, the per-voice WPM calibration model, and the cost model.
- **`custom_voices.{role}` config schema** in `~/.banana/config.json` — nested structure designed to support multiple semantic roles (narrator, character_a, brand_voice, etc.), three creation paths (designed, cloned, library), and per-voice metadata (model_id, source_type, design_method, guidance_scale, created_at, provider, notes). Forward-compatible for multi-provider future. Replaces the flat `custom_narrator_voice_id` field that briefly existed during the spike. **Lesson learned**: the flat field was a YAGNI miscall — when the user has *committed* future needs (multiple voices and clones), nested-now is correct.
- **`elevenlabs_api_key` field in `~/.banana/config.json`** alongside the existing Google AI / Replicate / Vertex keys. Resolved with the same precedence pattern: CLI flag → env var → config file.
- **12 empirical findings** in `references/video-audio.md` "Discoveries from real production" section, each with a `<!-- verified: 2026-04-14 -->` marker per the dated-verification principle. Findings cover: voice character anchoring (F1), delivery-mode drift / line-length calibration (F2), music seam problem (F3), VEO automatic ducking (F4), v3 audio tag flexibility / open-ended whitelist (F5), Eleven Music TOS guardrail on named creators (F6), Voice Design `should_enhance` behavior (F7), per-voice WPM differences (F8), Lite tier broadcast quality (F9), `[exhales]` audio tag (F10), capitalization emphasis (F11), ellipses pacing (F12).
- **New `/video audio ...` and `/video voice ...` slash command surface** documented in `skills/video/SKILL.md` Quick Reference table. Includes routing rules ("when to use VEO native narration vs the v3.7.1 pipeline") and prompt engineering guidance for the new audio pipeline.
- **ElevenLabs pricing rows in `cost_tracker.py`** for `eleven_v3`, `eleven_multilingual_v2`, `eleven_flash_v2_5`, `music_v1`, and `eleven_multilingual_sts_v2`. Subscription-billed users see negligible per-call cost; the entries support PAYG-equivalent estimates for users not on Creator tier.
- **`validate_setup.py` informational check for ElevenLabs config** (non-blocking — v3.7.1 is opt-in). Surfaces "ElevenLabs API key configured" + custom voice list when present.

### Changed

- **The v3.7.0 audio strategy split scope is fundamentally redefined.** The original plan was "split per-shot `audio` field into ambient/sfx/dialogue/narration + build a `/video sequence narration` TTS subcommand for multi-clip drift." After the strategic reset, the architecture is "use the v3.7.1 ElevenLabs replacement pipeline for sequences that need narration, custom voices, or seam-free music." The schema split work is deferred to v3.7.x as a refinement, not a v3.7.0 blocker.
- **`references/video-audio.md`** updated with the 12 empirical findings, the v3.7.1 audio replacement pipeline cross-reference, and a corrected "Limitations" section that points users to the audio swap workflow when audio quality is critical.
- **VEO Lite tier framing in `references/veo-models.md`** is informally re-evaluated based on F9: Lite is broadcast-quality for narrated documentary footage. The "draft only" framing is being relaxed in v3.7.1+ — Standard is reserved for shots with extreme detail (extras, complex character interactions, hero product shots), not the default for hero work.
- **`skills/video/SKILL.md`** Quick Reference table grew from 11 to 19 commands (new `/video audio ...` and `/video voice ...` subcommand groups). New "v3.7.1 Audio Replacement Pipeline" section in the body with routing rules, voice selection guidance, music TOS warning, and prompt engineering pointers for both TTS and music.

### Deferred to v3.7.2+

The strategic reset plan included three more spikes that were deferred when the user pivoted to shipping v3.7.1:

- **Spike 4 — Lyria 2 music smoke test** (~$0.50). Validates that Vertex AI Lyria 2/3 is callable through our existing Vertex API-key auth path. Lyria is Google's native music generation model and would be a complementary alternative to Eleven Music. Targets v3.7.2.
- **Spike 5 — Character consistency bake-off** (~$15-20). Generates 4-shot character sequences on VEO 3.1 Lite, Kling 2.6 (Replicate), and Runway Gen-4 (Replicate) for direct comparison. Informs whether v3.8.0 multi-provider abstraction is urgent or deferred. Targets v3.8.0.
- **Spike 6 — Banned-keywords re-validation** (~$1.50). Tests whether the 2025-era banned-keywords list (`"8K"`, `"masterpiece"`, `"ultra-realistic"`) still applies to Gemini 3.1 image generation. Quick, cheap, isolated. Targets v3.7.2 or v3.8.1.

### Verification

- **End-to-end empirical validation in spike 3 final prototype** at `~/Desktop/spike3-elevenlabs-audio/v3.7.1-final-prototype-veo-video-with-custom-voice.mp4`. The user verified the architecture produces ship-ready output: continuous narration, no music seams, natural ducking, custom-designed British baritone narrator voice. Quote: *"ok to proceed as is."*
- **Voice Design end-to-end flow** verified by promoting preview 3 (`DGEKfN3sQ7BmtUUNKoyI`) to the permanent voice "Nano Banana Narrator" and successfully calling TTS with the new voice.
- **Config schema migration** from flat `custom_narrator_voice_id` to nested `custom_voices.{role}` validated by atomic write + readback comparison.
- **No new Python pip dependencies.** `elevenlabs_audio.py` uses stdlib only (urllib.request, concurrent.futures, subprocess for FFmpeg). Matches the plugin's existing fallback-script pattern.
- **Total spike spend during the strategic reset session: $4.40 of VEO Lite generation** + ~0 ElevenLabs cost (subscription-billed within Creator tier quota).

### Known limitations (documented in `references/elevenlabs-audio.md`)

- Stereo output collapses to mono in the current FFmpeg mix graph (workaround possible in a v3.7.x patch — route narration through `pan=stereo|c0=c0|c1=c0`)
- Per-voice WPM is hardcoded rather than auto-measured on first use of a new voice
- Voice cloning (Instant Voice Clone, Professional Voice Clone) is not yet wired up — the `source_type: "cloned"` schema field is reserved for a future v3.7.x addition
- Music TOS guardrail is runtime-discovered, not validated pre-flight

## [3.6.3] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**Review gate enforcement + smarter plans.** Five more items from the deferred-bucket, all thematically coupled: make the review gate that v3.6.2 shipped actually useful, detect frame drift between review and generate, pre-fill shots with cinematography defaults so Claude has less to remember, and pay off the 1080p Lite pricing TODO from the v3.5.0 research.

### Added

- **`video_sequence.py generate` mandatory review gate.** `cmd_generate` now checks for `REVIEW-SHEET.md` in the storyboard directory and validates its embedded frame hashes against current disk state before doing any work. Missing, unparseable, or stale reviews abort with a clear error listing the exact fix command (either "run `review`" or "run `review` again because shot N's frame changed"). Pass `--skip-review` to bypass for CI/automation — intentionally disables the safety net.
- **Plan hash tracking via embedded manifest block.** `_build_review_sheet` now appends a machine-readable manifest wrapped in HTML comments (`<!-- BEGIN REVIEW MANIFEST v1 --> ... <!-- END ... -->`) containing the plan path, storyboard dir, and per-shot frame SHA-256 hashes. The block is inside a ````json` fenced code block so it doesn't render in markdown previews. `_check_review_freshness` parses the manifest on every `generate` run and compares against current hashes; any drift returns `{"status": "stale", "drifted_shots": [N, ...]}` and the gate aborts.
- **New helpers in `video_sequence.py`:** `_sha256_file`, `_build_review_manifest`, `_parse_review_manifest`, `_load_review_manifest`, `_check_review_freshness`. All stdlib-only, all unit-tested.
- **Shot-type semantic defaults** — new `SHOT_TYPE_DEFAULTS` table with 8 types (`establishing`, `content`, `medium`, `closeup`, `product`, `transition`, `cutaway`, `broll`) each mapping to default duration, camera hint, and `use_veo_interpolation` flag. `cmd_plan` accepts `--shot-types establishing,medium,closeup,product` and pre-fills shots with sensible defaults; shot count is determined by the list length and durations rescale to hit `--target`. Establishing/transition/cutaway/broll default to first-frame-only (they cut to unrelated material); content/medium/closeup/product default to first+last frame interpolation.
- **`--reference-image` flag on banana `generate.py`** — up to 3 reference images passed as `inlineData` parts alongside the text prompt. Primary use case: cross-shot character/product continuity in video sequences. Different from `edit.py` — reference-guided generation is "generate a new image informed by these anchors" vs edit's "modify this existing image." New helper `_read_reference_image` with PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF support and validation. Output JSON includes a note that reference-guided output is ~1K-ish regardless of `--resolution` request (known Gemini behavior).

### Changed

- **`cost_tracker.py` VEO 3.1 Lite comment** — the v3.5.0 TODO "verify 1080p Lite pricing" has been exercised empirically. 1080p Lite is callable via the Vertex AI backend with ~73 s generation time vs ~38 s for 720p. The rate is unchanged ($0.05/sec) pending a full billing cycle — flag in the comment that 1080p billing may differ and users should check their GCP console.
- **`cmd_plan` no longer hardcodes `type: "content"` for every shot.** When `--shot-types` is set, each shot's `type` field reflects the user's intent and the `camera`, `duration`, and `use_veo_interpolation` fields are pre-filled from `SHOT_TYPE_DEFAULTS`.
- **`cmd_plan` storyboard cost estimate** now accounts for `use_veo_interpolation` shots that skip the end frame (saves $0.08/frame). Previously the estimate assumed 2 frames per shot regardless.

### Docs

- **`video-sequences.md` Stage 3 (Review)** rewritten to describe the mandatory gate with frame hash tracking, the `--skip-review` bypass, and the design rationale (catching the most expensive category of mistake).
- **`video-sequences.md` Stage 1 (Shot List)** gets a new "Shot-type semantic defaults" subsection with the full 8-type table.
- **SKILL.md** Commands table and narrative section updated.
- **README.md** Commands table, What's New section, version badge.

### Verification

- All 6 scripts (`video_sequence.py`, `_vertex_backend.py`, `video_generate.py`, `video_extend.py`, banana `generate.py`, `cost_tracker.py`) compile clean.
- **8 new unit tests** via `python3 -c` import: `_shot_defaults` for all 8 types plus the unknown-type fallback; `_sha256_file` round-trip plus missing-file None; `_build_review_manifest` on a synthetic plan with interpolation and non-interpolation shots; review-sheet round-trip through `_load_review_manifest`; `_check_review_freshness` returns `ok` → `stale` (with correct `drifted_shots`) → `missing` as frames mutate; manifest parser handles raw JSON, `\`\`\`json` fenced, and bad/missing block cases.
- **Functional test of the gate** — ran `cmd_generate` against the coffee shop storyboard dir with REVIEW-SHEET.md deleted; pipeline correctly aborted with the "No REVIEW-SHEET.md found" error. Then ran with `--skip-review` to prove the bypass path works.
- **1080p Lite probe** ($0.40) — real 4-second clip generated via the Vertex AI backend at 1080p Lite, 73 seconds wall clock, 2.3 MB output at `/tmp/v363-pricing-probe/`. Confirms 1080p Lite is callable.

### Release-process honesty

**Unintended $0.40 spend during v3.6.3 verification.** When functionally testing the review gate's `--skip-review` path, I set `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=FAKE` expecting it to block any real API call. It didn't — the child `video_generate.py` process auto-routed Lite requests to the Vertex AI backend, which read real credentials from `~/.banana/config.json`, and generated one Shot 2 clip before I killed the pipeline. Total unintended spend: $0.40 (one 8-second Lite 1080p clip at `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences/sequence_clips_20260411_223403/clip-02.mp4`). Root cause: non-hermetic test harness. Going forward, any functional test of `cmd_generate` must use a fixture storyboard directory where the child process cannot successfully hit a real API, not just an env-var block on one of two possible auth paths.

### Not in scope (still deferred)

Everything else from the v3.6.1/v3.6.2 deferred buckets: the `update-prompts` Gemini-vision subcommand (v3.6.4), the audio strategy split (narration/dialogue/ambient/sfx fields, v3.7.0), the `/video sequence narration` TTS subcommand (v3.7.0 paired with audio split), `output_gcs_uri` support, `--num-videos` batching, parallel batch execution in `video_sequence.py`, object insertion support, and regional restrictions awareness. Each still needs its own dedicated release.

## [3.6.2] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**Sequence production polish.** Five small-but-high-value improvements surfaced by the coffee shop demo that shipped earlier today — the ones you notice the moment you run a real 4-shot sequence end-to-end. Zero new VEO API calls to verify; everything tested against fixture plans.

### Added

- **`video_sequence.py review` subcommand** — generates `REVIEW-SHEET.md` from a plan + storyboard directory. Each shot block shows frames inline, the full VEO prompt, resolved model + cost for the selected `--quality-tier`, and a ✅/⚠️ status badge. Sequence totals and any gaps blocking `generate` appear in the footer. Pure markdown, regenerated on demand, opens in Quick Look. This is the human approval gate between `storyboard` and `generate` that was previously an undocumented hand-written step. v3.6.2 ships it as a standalone subcommand; a `--skip-review` mandatory-gate integration is v3.6.3 scope.
- **5-stage pipeline**: `plan → storyboard → **review** → generate → stitch`. The review stage is now first-class in the docs, the SKILL.md routing table, the README Commands table, and the Quick Start example.
- **`use_veo_interpolation: true` per-shot flag in plan.json** — shots that should let VEO pick their own ending (establishing shots cutting away to unrelated material, transitions, etc.) can set this. The storyboard stage skips the end frame for those shots (saves $0.08/frame) and the generate stage drops `--last-frame` from the VEO call. Empirically validated by the coffee shop demo's Shot 1 where we used first-frame-only to let VEO execute a dramatic push-in. The field defaults to False so existing plans keep the strict first+last frame behavior.
- **`video_sequence.py storyboard --shots 1,3-5` partial regeneration** — new `--shots` flag accepts a comma-separated list of shot numbers and/or hyphen ranges. When set, the storyboard stage only regenerates the selected shots instead of rebuilding the whole storyboard. Critical for iteration when one frame has a bug but others are approved.
- **`_parse_shots_filter()` helper** in `video_sequence.py` — accepts `"1,3,5"`, `"2-4"`, `"1,3-5,7"`, or any mix. Validates and fails fast with a clear error on garbled input.
- **`_sanitize_project_name()` helper** — builds filesystem-safe slugs for per-project output subdirs. `"Golden Bean Cafe — 30s"` becomes `"golden-bean-cafe-30s"`.

### Changed

- **Default output location** is now `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences/` (was `~/Documents/nanobanana_generated/`). Visible from Finder, works with Quick Look (Space key), per-project subdirs when a project name is provided. `LEGACY_OUTPUT_BASE` still points at the old path for documentation continuity.
- **`_default_output(suffix, project_name=None)`** now accepts an optional `project_name` argument. With a project name, the layout becomes `~/Documents/nano-banana-sequences/<project-slug>/<suffix>/` so all stages of one project cluster together.
- **Storyboard stage cost accounting** — shots with `use_veo_interpolation=true` only charge for one frame ($0.08) instead of two ($0.16). The estimate subcommand and the review sheet both reflect this.
- **`cmd_storyboard()` missing-frame error messages** now distinguish "missing start frame" (always fatal) from "missing end frame" (fatal only when `use_veo_interpolation=false`). The error text also points users at the flag they can set to unblock themselves.

### Docs

- **`video-sequences.md`** section "The 4-Stage Pipeline" renamed to "The 5-Stage Pipeline" with a new Stage 3 (Review) block describing the review subcommand, its cost-free nature, and the decision not to hard-enforce the gate in v3.6.2.
- **`SKILL.md`** Commands table and narrative section updated with the review subcommand, partial regeneration flag, and `use_veo_interpolation` option.
- **`README.md`** Commands table, Quick Start example, and What's New section all updated.

### Verification

- All 4 video scripts still compile clean.
- `_parse_shots_filter` unit test covers the four supported syntaxes (None, `"1,3,5"`, `"2-4"`, `"1,3-5,7"`).
- Real-data test: ran `video_sequence.py review --plan /tmp/coffee-shop-demo/plan.json --storyboard /tmp/coffee-shop-demo/storyboard --quality-tier draft` against the coffee shop demo fixture from earlier today. With Shot 1 marked `use_veo_interpolation=true` and filename symlinks in place, the review sheet reports 4/4 ready, $0.55 storyboard cost, $1.50 video cost (Lite draft), $2.05 total, and the Shot 1 block correctly shows "first-frame-only (VEO interpolates ending)" with no end-frame slot.
- **Zero new VEO spend this release** — all testing used fixtures from earlier v3.6.1 work.

### Not in scope for v3.6.2 (deferred to v3.6.3+)

Everything else in the original v3.6.1 deferred bucket: plan hash tracking with SHA-256, the `update-prompts` Gemini-vision subcommand, the review-as-mandatory-gate enforcement with `--skip-review`, the audio strategy split (narration/dialogue/ambient/sfx fields), the `/video sequence narration` TTS subcommand, shot-type semantic effects, `/banana` skill improvements (`--reference-image` flag on `generate.py`, conservatism bias docs), and the v3.6.0-research batch (`--num-videos`, object insertion, parallel execution, `output_gcs_uri`, regional detection, 1080p Lite pricing verification). These items need their own dedicated releases with proper plans — especially the audio strategy split which is a real product decision, not a code change.

## [3.6.1] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**First+last frame interpolation and reference images now work on the Vertex AI backend.** v3.6.0 shipped the Vertex backend with `--first-frame` support but deferred `--last-frame` and `--reference-image` to v3.6.1 because the field names weren't empirically verified. Two authoritative Google doc pages published in the [Vertex first/last frame reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/video/generate-videos-from-first-and-last-frames) and the [Gemini API video guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video) confirmed the field names as `lastFrame` (camelCase, nested at the instance level alongside `image`) and `referenceImages` (an array of `{image, referenceType: "asset"}` entries). Wiring them in took ~40 lines in `_vertex_backend.build_vertex_request_body` plus removing the `_error_exit` stubs in `_submit_vertex_ai`. Verified end-to-end with a Lite first+last frame smoke test ($0.20) using coffee shop Shot 2's storyboard frames — real 2.27 MB MP4 produced in 42 seconds.

### Added
- **`last_frame_path` parameter** on `_vertex_backend.build_vertex_request_body`. Builds the `lastFrame` field as a sibling of `image` at the instance level with `bytesBase64Encoded` + `mimeType`. Same camelCase field name used by both the Vertex AI REST reference and the Gemini API docs.
- **`reference_image_paths` parameter** on `_vertex_backend.build_vertex_request_body`. Builds the `referenceImages` array (up to 3 entries) with each entry as `{image: {bytesBase64Encoded, mimeType}, referenceType: "asset"}`. Matches the structure shown in the official Google Veo 3 notebook and the Gemini API bash curl example.
- **Four new mutual-exclusion checks** in `build_vertex_request_body`: (1) `video_input` cannot combine with any image inputs, (2) `last_frame` requires `image` (since `lastFrame` is always paired), (3) `reference_images` cannot combine with `image` or `last_frame` (separate Vertex code paths), (4) `reference_images` capped at 3 entries.

### Fixed
- **`--last-frame` on the Vertex AI backend** — v3.6.0 raised `_error_exit("--last-frame is not yet supported on the Vertex AI backend")`. v3.6.1 lets it through to the wire. Works for all five VEO 3.1 model IDs (Standard/Fast/Lite, both preview and GA `-001`). VEO 3.0 does not support first+last frame per Vertex docs; the API will reject it with a clear error if a user tries.
- **`--reference-image` on the Vertex AI backend** — same deferred-error was removed. Vertex supports reference images for all VEO 3.1 tiers except Lite per Google's parameter table; Lite requests with reference images will be rejected by the API.

### Docs
- **`_vertex_backend.py` docstring** on `build_vertex_request_body` rewritten with the full list of input modes (text-to-video, image-to-video, first+last interpolation, reference-guided, Scene Extension v2) and their mutual exclusions.
- **`_submit_vertex_ai` docstring** updated to note the v3.6.1 additions and link to the source docs.

### Verification
- 8 new unit checks on `build_vertex_request_body` covering last_frame, reference_images, and all 4 new mutual-exclusion rules. The original 18 commit-1 checks still pass.
- Real API ($0.20): Lite first+last frame on coffee shop Shot 2 storyboard frames, 42s wall clock, 2.27 MB MP4 saved to `/tmp/v361-smoke/`.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-04-11

### Headline

**Vertex AI backend with API-key auth — unblocks the full VEO 3.1 capability surface.** The Gemini API surface (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) the plugin had been using only serves text-to-video on two preview model IDs. v3.5.0 documented every other VEO feature as "Vertex AI only — gated until v3.6.0" — image-to-video, Lite, Legacy 3.0, GA `-001` IDs, and Scene Extension v2 all returned clear errors instead of silent HTTP 404s. v3.6.0 wires up the Vertex AI backend with a stdlib-only request translator using bound-to-service-account API key auth (no OAuth, no service account JSON, no `gcloud` install required), un-gates everything, and re-points `--quality-tier draft` from the v3.5.0 Fast stopgap back to Lite for the full **8× cost reduction**.

### Fixed
- **Image-to-video / `--first-frame` / `--last-frame` / `--reference-image`** — the Gemini API surface stopped serving image-to-video for VEO when the GA `-001` IDs shipped on Vertex AI in March 2026. v3.6.0's Vertex backend handles all of these. `video_generate.py --first-frame` works again.
- **`video_extend.py --method video` (Scene Extension v2)** — re-enabled as the default. The Vertex API accepts inline base64 video input via `instances[0].video.bytesBase64Encoded` (despite Google's docs only showing the `gcsUri` path). Verified end-to-end with a 1.69 MB → 4.5 MB MP4 generation.
- **Lite duration constraint** — v3.5.0 documented Lite as supporting 5–60 second durations based on unverified docs. Real-API testing during v3.6.0 showed the API explicitly rejects 5-second Lite requests with `"supported durations are [8,4,6] for feature text_to_video"`. Lite is `{4, 6, 8}` like every other tier. The error message and argparse help text are corrected.
- **1:1 aspect ratio claim for Lite** — v3.5.0 documented `1:1` as a Lite-only special-case based on unverified docs. The Vertex docs and the official Google Veo 3 notebook both list only `16:9` and `9:16`. v3.6.0 removes the special-case from `_valid_ratios()` and `video_generate.py`, and adds defense-in-depth validation in the Vertex request body builder.
- **`video_extend.py GENERATE_DURATION` for Scene Extension v2** — was hardcoded to `8` (correct for the keyframe path) but Vertex's `feature=video_extension` accepts only `durationSeconds=7`. Replaced with two named constants `GENERATE_DURATION_KEYFRAME=8` and `GENERATE_DURATION_VIDEO=7`, dispatched via `_hop_duration_for_method()`.

### Added
- **`skills/video/scripts/_vertex_backend.py`** (NEW, ~650 lines) — pure data translation helper module for the Vertex AI VEO surface. Handles URL composition (regional + global endpoints, hard-coded `/v1/` to avoid SDK [issue #2079](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai/issues/2079) routing bug), request body construction (`instances`/`parameters` wrapper with `bytesBase64Encoded` image/video parts, resolution normalization `4K → 4k`, defense-in-depth aspect ratio + Scene Extension v2 duration validation), submit + poll response parsing (handles all three known response shapes including the Vertex `cloud.ai.large_models.vision.GenerateVideoResponse` payload), and a `--diagnose` CLI for verifying the auth setup against a free Gemini text-gen sanity check.
- **`--backend {auto,gemini-api,vertex-ai}` flag** on `video_generate.py`, default `auto`. Routes Vertex-only features through Vertex automatically and keeps text-to-video on Gemini API for v3.4.x compat. Zero breaking changes for existing users.
- **`--vertex-api-key` / `--vertex-project` / `--vertex-location` flags** on `video_generate.py` with the same precedence as `--api-key`: CLI flag → env var → `~/.banana/config.json`.
- **`vertex_api_key` / `vertex_project_id` / `vertex_location` fields** in `~/.banana/config.json`. Backward compat: existing configs without these fields continue to work for the Gemini API path.
- **Service-agent provisioning auto-retry** — the first Scene Extension v2 call against a fresh Vertex project returns a transient `"Service agents are being provisioned"` error (gRPC code 9) that auto-resolves in ~60-90 s. `video_generate.py` detects this specific error and retries once after a 90-second sleep, with a clear progress event explaining the wait. Subsequent failures surface to the user with a pointer to the Vertex AI service-agents doc.
- **Scene Extension v2 duration auto-override** — `video_generate.py` auto-overrides `--duration` to `7` when `--video-input` routes to Vertex (matches the auto-720p-downgrade pattern v3.5.0 added).
- **`backend` field in output JSON** — every successful generation now reports which backend produced it (`"backend": "gemini-api"` or `"backend": "vertex-ai"`).

### Changed
- **`--quality-tier draft` re-pointed from Fast to Lite** in `video_sequence.py`. The v3.5.0 stopgap mapped `draft` to Fast ($0.15/sec, 2.7× cheaper than Standard) because Lite was unreachable. v3.6.0 restores the original mapping to Lite ($0.05/sec, **8× cheaper**). On a 4-shot 30-second sequence, the draft pass cost drops from $4.80 to $1.60.
- **`video_extend.py --method` default flipped from `keyframe` back to `video`** (Scene Extension v2). The legacy keyframe path remains available via `--method keyframe` for users who need 1080p extension.
- **`download_expires_at` is now backend-scoped** — only emitted on the Gemini API path (where the 48-hour URI expiry actually applies). The Vertex AI path returns video bytes inline in the poll response, so there's no URI and no expiry. The stderr 48-hour warning is also Gemini-only.
- **`_submit_operation`, `_poll_operation`, `_save_video`** in `video_generate.py` are now backend-aware dispatchers. The Gemini API code paths are preserved byte-identical for backward compat; the Vertex paths call into the new `_vertex_backend` module.

### Docs
- **Full rewrite of `skills/video/references/veo-models.md`** Backend Availability section. Removes the v3.5.0 "Vertex AI only — gated" warnings, documents the 3-minute auth setup, explains why API-key auth works for Vertex (bound-to-service-account keys carry a service account principal), corrects the Lite duration and aspect ratio claims, lists the canonical protobuf type names from the REST reference (`VideoGenerationModelInstance`, `VideoGenerationModelParams`, `cloud.ai.large_models.vision.GenerateVideoResponse`), and explains that video retention only applies to the Gemini API path.
- **`skills/video/references/video-sequences.md` draft-then-final cost table** restored to the 8× story. The v3.5.0 "Gemini API today vs Vertex AI later" two-table workaround is gone — there's now one cost comparison and Lite is the default draft tier.
- **`skills/video/SKILL.md` Model Routing table** is back to 5 rows (draft / quick social / standard / hero / image-to-video / legacy) with a Backend column showing where each routes. The "Vertex AI only — gated" callout is gone.
- **README "What's New" section** rewritten with the v3.6.0 backend story.
- **CLAUDE.md** updated with the new helper script in the file responsibilities table and a new key-constraint about Vertex resolution case (`4k` lowercase) vs Gemini convention (`4K` uppercase).
- **ROADMAP** marks v3.6.0 as shipped, removes the "Vertex AI backend" line from the top, and promotes the deferred sequence production improvements to v3.6.1.

### Verification
- **Real API:** $0.55 spent across three smoke tests during research ($0.20 Lite text-to-video, $0.20 Lite image-to-video, $0.35 Lite Scene Extension v2 with retry) plus $0.20 for the commit 2 integration smoke test. Real MP4 artifacts saved to `/tmp/v360-verify/` and `/tmp/v360-commit2/` for inspection.
- **Zero-cost:** all 4 modified scripts compile clean, 18 unit checks via import on `_vertex_backend.py`, backend routing tested for all 4 combinations (auto + Gemini path, auto + Vertex path, explicit Gemini, explicit Vertex), 1:1 aspect rejection verified, Lite duration 4 acceptance verified, draft tier cost calculation confirmed at $1.11 for the test plan (down from $2.71).

## [3.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### ⚠️ Backend Reality Check

Real-API verification during the v3.5.0 release surfaced a critical distinction: **VEO 3.1 is split across two backends**. The plugin uses the Gemini API (`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`, API-key auth), while Lite, Legacy 3.0, GA `-001` IDs for Standard/Fast, and Scene Extension v2 (`--video-input`) are **Vertex AI only** (`*-aiplatform.googleapis.com`, OAuth/service-account auth). The Gemini API returns HTTP 404 for every `-001` ID and rejects `--video-input` with "inlineData isn't supported by this model." Until the Vertex AI backend ships in v3.6.0, the plugin gates these features with clear error messages and remaps `--quality-tier draft` to Fast instead of Lite. See `skills/video/references/veo-models.md` → Backend Availability for full details. Vertex AI support is now tracked as the top v3.6.0 roadmap item.

### Fixed
- **VEO Lite model ID** — the plugin previously shipped `veo-3.1-generate-lite-preview` which does not exist as a real API endpoint. v3.5.0 ships the correct GA ID `veo-3.1-lite-generate-001` for users running against Vertex AI directly, and documents it for the Gemini API path with a clear error pointing at the v3.6.0 Vertex AI backend.
- **VEO pricing** — the cost tracker's Standard rate was incorrectly set to $0.15/sec. Corrected to the official $0.40/sec ($3.20 per 8s clip) matching Google Cloud Vertex AI pricing. Fast ($0.15/sec) and Lite ($0.05/sec) tiers are now listed separately rather than conflated.

### Added
- **VEO 3.1 model variants** in `video_generate.py` — Fast tier (`veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview` / `-001`), Lite tier (`veo-3.1-lite-generate-001`), and Legacy 3.0 (`veo-3.0-generate-001`). Both preview and GA (`-001`) IDs are accepted for Standard and Fast.
- **Model-aware parameter validation** — Lite supports 5–60 s durations and 1:1 square aspect ratio; Standard/Fast reject those. 4K is rejected on Lite and Legacy 3.0.
- **`--negative-prompt`** flag on `video_generate.py` with Google's official guidance (describe what you want; use negatives only for known failure modes).
- **`--seed`** flag on `video_generate.py` for reproducible generations.
- **`--video-input`** flag on `video_generate.py` — Scene Extension v2 mode, mutually exclusive with image inputs, forces 720p.
- **`--quality-tier {draft,fast,standard,lite,legacy}`** flag on `video_sequence.py generate` and `estimate` — enables the draft-then-final workflow. `draft` currently maps to Fast ($0.15/sec, 2.7× cheaper than Standard) on the Gemini API; `lite` and `legacy` fail fast with a clear pointer to the v3.6.0 Vertex AI backend. A 4-shot 30-second sequence costs $4.80 at Fast draft vs $12.80 at Standard.
- **Per-shot and sequence-level `model`/`resolution` fields** in the plan.json schema, with a 3-level cascade (CLI override → shot → plan → default) and graceful fallback for old plans.
- **`--method {video,keyframe}`** flag on `video_extend.py`. Default is `video` (Scene Extension v2: passes previous clip directly, preserves audio continuity at 720p). `keyframe` retains the legacy last-frame extraction path at any resolution.
- **`--model` flag on `video_extend.py`** with per-hop cost estimation using the selected model's actual rate.
- **Token-limit prompt validation** in `video_generate.py` — warns at ~950 tokens (3,800 chars), hard-rejects at ~1,125 tokens (4,500 chars) to prevent confusing API-layer failures.
- **`download_expires_at` timestamp** in `video_generate.py` JSON output and a stderr warning about Google's 48-hour video retention window.
- **New `_veo_cost(model, duration_seconds)` helper** in `cost_tracker.py` with per-second fallback for Lite's extended 5–60 s range.
- **README: "VEO 3.1 Model Variants & Draft Workflow (v3.5.0)"** section.

### Changed
- **`video_extend.py` default method** is `keyframe` (last-frame extraction, works on the Gemini API today at any resolution). `--method video` (Scene Extension v2, preserves audio continuity) is documented but errors with a clear Vertex-AI-required message until v3.6.0.
- **`video_sequence.py` cost estimation** now uses real per-tier rates instead of a flat $1.20/clip. Output includes a per-model breakdown.
- **Video SKILL.md Model Routing table** rewritten with 5 scenarios (draft / quick social / standard / hero / legacy) and a draft-first recommendation.

### Docs
- **Full rewrite of `skills/video/references/veo-models.md`** with the VEO release timeline, 3-tier comparison table, GA vs preview IDs, 4K-is-AI-upscaled clarification, capability matrix, known limitations (character drift, text rendering, 8 s ceiling, silent output failures), 48-hour video retention, regional availability (EEA/Swiss/UK), rate limits, competitive context (Arena Elo 1381), and audio quality comparison.
- **`skills/video/references/video-sequences.md`** — new draft-then-final workflow section with cost comparison table, Gemini + VEO as Google's officially recommended pattern, timestamp prompting as a cost-reduction technique, and character drift mitigation framing.
- **`skills/video/references/video-prompt-engineering.md`** — new sections for timestamp prompting (`[00:00-00:02]` syntax), lens focal length guidance (16 mm / 35 mm / 50 mm / 85 mm table), dialogue timing (words-per-clip by duration), recommended negative prompt boilerplate, text rendering warning, and 100–200 word prompt-length target.
- **README** version badge bumped, model comparison table updated with all four VEO variants and per-second pricing.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-04-09

- **`slides.py`** script with `generate`, `estimate`, and `template` subcommands
- 4 new slide-type prompt templates: quote, section divider, image feature, infographic process
- `references/setup.md` -- extracted setup instructions for lazy loading

### Changed
- **SKILL.md restructured as lean orchestrator** (496 → 170 lines, 66% reduction)

### Added
- **Presentation domain mode** with two generation options:
  - **Complete Slide** -- model renders headline/body text directly (leverages Nano Banana 2's 94% text accuracy)
  - **Background Only** -- clean backgrounds with negative space for layering in Keynote/PPT/Slides
- **Brand Style Guides** -- 8 new optional preset fields for project-wide visual consistency:
  - `background_styles` -- named background variants (dark-premium, gradient, split-layout)

  - `do_list` / `dont_list` -- brand guardrails checked before generation
  - `logo_placement` -- records post-production logo position (never mentioned in prompts)
  - `technical_specs` -- default color space, DPI, etc.
