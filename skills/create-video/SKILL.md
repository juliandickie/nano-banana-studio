# Creators Studio -- Video Creative Director

<!-- Kling v3 Std (default) + VEO 3.1 (backup) | Shares presets/assets with /create-image skill | Version managed in plugin.json -->
<!-- This skill uses /create-video command. Part of the creators-studio plugin. -->

## Core Principles

1. **Creative Director for Video** -- NEVER pass raw user text to the video model. Interpret intent, enhance with cinematic language, and construct an optimized video prompt.
2. **Audio is Always Part of the Prompt** -- Both Kling v3 Std (default as of v3.8.0) and VEO 3.1 generate synchronized audio. Every prompt should include dialogue (in quotes), SFX (prefix "SFX:"), or ambient sound descriptions. **Kling audio works best in English and Chinese** per the model card — for other languages, consider generating without audio and using the audio_pipeline.py replacement path.
3. **Clip Length Thinking** -- Kling supports 3-15 second single-call clips; VEO supports {4, 6, 8}. For sequences beyond 15 seconds, use `video_sequence.py` with independent shot calls stitched by FFmpeg.
4. **Storyboard Before Generating** -- For sequences, generate still frame previews first. Video generation is expensive even on Kling ($0.16/8s; VEO Standard is $3.20/8s). Preview with images ($0.08/frame) before committing.
5. **Image-to-Video & Character Consistency** -- Animate existing assets from `/create-image` for visual consistency. **Both Kling and VEO support start_image**; Kling also supports `end_image` for first-and-last-frame interpolation. **For multi-clip character consistency (v3.8.2+)**: pass the same reference image as `--first-frame` on every Kling call AND write each prompt to describe the SAME character as the image (matching age, hair, clothing, setting). Mismatched prompts will override the start image's identity within 5 seconds. Works for human and non-human characters. See `references/kling-models.md` §Character Consistency. **Caveat**: when passing a start image to Kling, the `aspect_ratio` parameter is IGNORED — output uses the start image's native aspect ratio per the Kling model card.

## Video Creative Director Pipeline

Follow this for every generation -- no exceptions:

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Same 5-Input Creative Brief as image generation: **Purpose** (where used?), **Audience** (who for?), **Subject** (what?), **Brand** (what vibe?), **References** (visual examples?). Additionally ask: **Duration** (how long?), **Audio** (dialogue, music, SFX?). See `references/video-prompt-engineering.md`.

### Step 2: Check for Presets

If user mentions a brand/preset, load from shared system:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/presets.py list
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/presets.py show NAME
```
Preset `prompt_suffix`, `lighting`, `mood`, and `colors` apply to video prompts identically to image prompts.

### Step 3: Check for Assets

If user mentions a named character, product, or object:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/assets.py list
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/assets.py show NAME
```
Pass `reference_images[]` to VEO (up to 3 per shot). Append `consistency_notes` to the prompt. See `references/image-to-video.md`.

### Step 4: Select Video Domain Mode

Choose from: **Product Reveal**, **Story-Driven**, **Environment Reveal**, **Social Short**, **Cinematic**, **Tutorial/Demo**. See `references/video-domain-modes.md` for camera specs, modifier libraries, and shot type guidance.

### Step 5: Construct Video Prompt

Use the **5-Part Video Framework**: Camera → Subject → Action → Setting → Style + Audio. Write as natural narrative prose. See `references/video-prompt-engineering.md` for templates and examples.

**Critical rules:**
- Use professional cinematography language: "dolly," "rack focus," "tracking shot"
- Include audio in every prompt: dialogue in quotes, SFX with "SFX:" prefix, ambient as description
- One dominant action per clip (must complete within 4-8 seconds)
- NEVER use banned keywords: "8K," "masterpiece," "ultra-realistic"
- For character consistency: repeat exact identity phrasing across all shots AND pass the character's reference image as `--first-frame` on every Kling call. The prompt MUST describe the same character as the image — mismatched descriptions cause Kling to morph toward the prompted character within 5 seconds. See `references/kling-models.md` §Character Consistency

### Step 6: Set Duration + Aspect Ratio + Resolution

| Parameter | Kling v3 Std (default) | VEO 3.1 (backup) | Plugin default |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Duration | any integer 3-15s | {4, 6, 8} | 8s |
| Aspect ratio | 16:9, 9:16, **1:1** | 16:9, 9:16 | 16:9 |
| Resolution | 720p (standard) or 1080p (pro) | 720p, 1080p, 4K | 1080p |

### Step 7: Call the video generation script

```bash
# Default (Kling v3 Std as of v3.8.0)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_generate.py --prompt "..." --duration 8 --aspect-ratio 16:9 --resolution 1080p
```

As of v3.8.0, the default provider is **Kling v3 Std** via Replicate. Generation is async: the script submits the prediction, polls for completion (printing progress to stderr), and downloads the MP4 when done. **Typical Kling wall time: 3-6 minutes per call** — longer than VEO Lite's ~2 minutes, which is the trade-off for Kling's 7.5× lower cost and higher motion quality.

**For VEO 3.1 (opt-in backup, requires explicit request):**
```bash
# Route to VEO Lite (cheapest VEO tier, spike 5 recommended)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_generate.py --provider veo --tier lite --prompt "..." --duration 8
```

**WARNING when routing to VEO**: Spike 5 found VEO's multi-shot workflows produce glitches at extended durations. When a user explicitly requests VEO, recommend generating both a Kling version and a VEO version for comparison before committing to VEO for production work. See `references/veo-models.md` → "v3.8.0 status: BACKUP ONLY" for the full findings.

**For image-to-video (animate a still):**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_generate.py --prompt "..." --first-frame PATH
```

**Caveat for Kling + start_image**: Kling ignores the `aspect_ratio` parameter when `start_image` is provided — output uses the start image's native aspect. If the user requested a specific aspect ratio alongside a first-frame, note that Replicate will override it. Offer to crop or pad the start image first if the aspect conflict matters.

**For first/last frame (keyframe interpolation):**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_generate.py --prompt "..." --first-frame START.png --last-frame END.png
```

Both Kling and VEO support this. Kling's `end_image` requires `start_image`.

### Step 8: Post-Processing

If needed, use FFmpeg for trimming, format conversion, or concatenation:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -t 6 -c copy trimmed.mp4          # Trim to 6 seconds
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=1920:1080 output.mp4     # Resize
```
Check availability first: `which ffmpeg || echo "FFmpeg not installed"`

### Step 9: Handle Errors

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `VIDEO_SAFETY` | Rephrase prompt. Common triggers: "fire" → "flames", "shot" → "filmed". Max 3 attempts with user approval. |
| HTTP 429 | Wait 10s, exponential backoff, max 3 retries |
| HTTP 403 | Billing not enabled -- VEO has no free tier. Inform user. |
| HTTP 5xx | Server error -- wait 10s, retry with backoff, max 3 retries |
| Poll timeout | Generation took too long (>300s). Retry once, or try `veo-3.1-lite-generate-001` (Lite, ~25-40 s typical) for faster results. |
| Invalid API key | Suggest running `/create-image setup` to reconfigure |

### Step 10: Log Cost + History

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/cost_tracker.py log --model MODEL --resolution DURATION --prompt "brief"
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/history.py log --prompt "full prompt" --image-path PATH --model MODEL --ratio RATIO --resolution DURATION --type video --session-id SESSION_ID
```

### Step 11: Return Results

Always provide: **video path**, **crafted prompt** (educational), **settings** (model, duration, ratio), **audio description** (what VEO generated), **suggestions** (1-2 refinements or next steps).

## /create-video animate (Image-to-Video)

Animate a still image generated with `/create-image` or uploaded by the user. See `references/image-to-video.md`.
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_generate.py --prompt "slow orbit revealing the product" --first-frame PATH
```

## /create-video sequence (Multi-Shot Production)

For sequences longer than 8 seconds: **plan → storyboard → review → generate → stitch**. See `references/video-sequences.md`.

The storyboard stage generates still frame pairs using `/create-image generate` for visual approval before committing to video generation. This saves costs ($0.08/frame vs $1.20+/clip). The **review** stage (v3.6.2) produces a `REVIEW-SHEET.md` that interleaves each shot's frames, VEO prompt, cost estimate, and parameters into a single markdown file you can open in Quick Look. v3.6.3 promotes review to a **mandatory gate**: `generate` refuses to run unless `REVIEW-SHEET.md` exists and its embedded frame hashes match the current storyboard. Pass `--skip-review` to bypass for CI/automation.

**Shot-type semantic defaults** (v3.6.3): pass `--shot-types establishing,medium,closeup,product` to `plan` to pre-fill duration, camera hints, and `use_veo_interpolation` defaults from a built-in 8-type table. Useful for standard commercial structures. Claude can override any field in plan.json after generation.

**Partial iteration:** if one frame needs a redo but the rest are approved, use `video_sequence.py storyboard --shots 3` (or `--shots 1,3-5`) to regenerate only a subset. Shots with `use_veo_interpolation: true` in plan.json skip the end frame entirely — useful for establishing shots that cut away to unrelated material.

## /create-video extend

**DEPRECATED in v3.8.0.** Spike 5 Phase 2C found VEO extended workflows (both Scene Extension v2 and keyframe fallback) produce glitches, inconsistent actors, and audio seam discontinuities at extended durations — user verdict 2026-04-15: "horrible, do not use."

`video_extend.py` now requires `--acknowledge-veo-limitations` to run. Without the flag, the script exits with code 2 and a deprecation message pointing users at `video_sequence.py`.

**Recommended extended workflow path (v3.8.0+)**: Use `video_sequence.py` with the existing plan → storyboard → generate → stitch pipeline. Each shot is an independent Kling v3 Std API call, stitched by FFmpeg.

```bash
# Recommended: extended workflow via Kling shot list
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py plan --script "30-second product launch" --target 30
# ... follow the standard video_sequence pipeline (storyboard → review → generate → stitch)

# Only if user explicitly accepts the spike 5 findings:
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_extend.py --input clip.mp4 --target-duration 30 --acknowledge-veo-limitations
```

## Model Routing

| Scenario | Model | Duration | Backend | When |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|------|
| **Default (everything)** | **`kwaivgi/kling-v3-video`** | **3-15s** | **Replicate (auto)** | **v3.8.0+ default. $0.16/8s at 1080p pro mode.** |
| Instagram square | `kwaivgi/kling-v3-video` | 8s | Replicate | Kling is the ONLY plugin-registered model with 1:1 support |
| Speed-critical iteration | `veo-3.1-lite-generate-001` | 4-8s | Vertex | ~2 min wall time vs Kling's 3-6 min — trade quality for speed |
| VEO output comparison | `veo-3.1-lite-generate-001` | 4-8s | Vertex | Explicit VEO opt-in. **Warn user about spike 5 findings.** |
| 4K output | `veo-3.1-generate-preview` / `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview` | 4-8s | Gemini API | Kling maxes at 1080p pro |
| Reference-image guided | VEO any tier | 4-8s | Vertex | Kling does not support `referenceImages` |
| Scene Extension v2 | Not recommended | — | — | **Deprecated in v3.8.0**. Use Kling shot list instead. |
| Legacy 3.0 reproduction | `veo-3.0-generate-001` | 8s | Vertex (auto) | Match existing VEO 3.0 style (opt-in) |

Default model: `kwaivgi/kling-v3-video` (Kling v3 Std). Default backend: `auto`
(routes Replicate slugs to Kling, Vertex-only VEO features to Vertex, text-
only VEO preview IDs to Gemini API). **VEO is opt-in backup only** as of
v3.8.0 — always prefer Kling unless the user specifically requests VEO.

**Replicate setup** (1 minute, one-time): add `replicate_api_token` to
`~/.banana/config.json`. If the plugin's image-gen side was already used,
the token is already in place — no new setup needed. Otherwise:
`python3 skills/create-image/scripts/setup_mcp.py --replicate-key YOUR_TOKEN`.
Get a token at https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens.

**Vertex AI setup** (for opt-in VEO backup, 3 minutes, one-time): add
`vertex_api_key`, `vertex_project_id`, and `vertex_location` to
`~/.banana/config.json`. See `references/veo-models.md` → Backend Availability
for the bound-to-service-account API key creation steps.

## Audio Quick Guide

VEO 3.1 generates synchronized audio. Include in every prompt:
- **Dialogue:** `A man says, "Welcome to our studio."` (in quotes)
- **SFX:** `SFX: glass shattering, metallic echo` (prefix "SFX:")
- **Ambient:** `Quiet hum of machinery, distant traffic` (natural description)
- **Music:** `Soft piano melody in the background` (describe style)
- **Narration (no visible speaker):** `A narrator says, "..."` — works ONLY when no human is visible in frame; if a person is visible, VEO will lip-sync them to the line regardless of prompt wording (verified spike 1, 2026-04-14)
- **Narration line length:** for an 8s clip, target ~16 words at narrator pace. Shorter lines trigger a known failure mode where VEO sings the line to fill time. See `references/video-audio.md` F2.

See `references/video-audio.md` for VEO-native audio prompting and the 12 empirical findings from the strategic reset spikes.

## v3.7.1+v3.7.2 Audio Replacement Pipeline (for multi-clip sequences)

**When to use:** the user is producing a multi-clip stitched sequence and (a) wants narration over visible characters, OR (b) wants a continuous music bed without seams at clip boundaries, OR (c) wants a custom-designed branded narrator voice instead of VEO's emergent voice, OR (d) wants higher-fidelity music than VEO's emergent bed (Lyria 2 is 48kHz/192kbps stereo).

**What it does:** strips the VEO video's audio entirely and replaces it with continuous ElevenLabs TTS narration + background music (**Google Lyria 2 by default** as of v3.7.2, ElevenLabs Music as the alternative) + FFmpeg ducked mix. The TTS and music API calls run in parallel for ~12s total latency.

**Music source choice (v3.8.3):** ElevenLabs Music is the default after a 12-genre blind A/B bake-off produced a decisive ElevenLabs 12-0 sweep over Lyria (session 19, 2026-04-16). Use `--music-source lyria` when you need `--negative-prompt` exclusion or lack an ElevenLabs subscription. See `references/audio-pipeline.md` for the full decision matrix and bake-off results.

**Canonical command:**

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/audio_pipeline.py pipeline \
  --video stitched-sequence.mp4 \
  --text "Each year... the seasons change across this valley, painting the forest in red and gold. [exhales] The river runs COLD here..." \
  --music-prompt "Cinematic nature documentary background score, slow contemplative warm orchestral strings with soft piano, instrumental only, no vocals, around 70 BPM" \
  --voice narrator \
  --out final.mp4
```

**Routing rules (Creative Director discipline):**

- **Single-shot social reel with no visible character** → use VEO native narration (`A narrator says, "..."`). Cheaper, simpler, fewer dependencies.
- **Single-shot reel WITH visible character but you want narration** → use the v3.7.1 pipeline. VEO will otherwise lip-sync the visible character to the narration line.
- **Multi-shot sequence (2+ clips) with narration** → use the v3.7.1 pipeline. VEO's per-clip music seams will otherwise be audible at every cut.
- **Multi-shot sequence without narration** → VEO native ambient + SFX is fine. Music seams are still present but less obvious without speech to draw attention to them.

**Voice selection:**

- Default: `--voice narrator` reads the saved `custom_voices.narrator` from `~/.banana/config.json`.
- To use a different role: `--voice character_a` (reads `custom_voices.character_a`).
- To use a literal ElevenLabs voice ID: `--voice 21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM` (any non-role string is treated as a literal ID).
- To create a new custom voice: `voice-design` then `voice-promote`. See `references/audio-pipeline.md`.

**Music prompt restriction (TOS guardrail):** Eleven Music blocks prompts that name copyrighted creators or brands (e.g. "Annie Leibovitz", "BBC Earth"). Use generic descriptors only — genre, mood, instrumentation, tempo. This is music-API-specific — image generation prompts welcome creator names.

**Prompt engineering for ElevenLabs TTS narration:**

- Use `eleven_v3` model (default) for expressiveness
- Insert audio tags like `[exhales]`, `[reverent]`, `[contemplative]` for emotional beats — tag set is open-ended, not whitelisted
- Use ellipses (`...`) for contemplative pauses
- Use selective CAPS for emphasis on key words
- Match line length to the *voice's* WPM (different voices have different pacing — see `references/audio-pipeline.md` line-length calibration section)

See `references/audio-pipeline.md` for the full architecture, FFmpeg parameter rationale, voice design flow, custom voice schema, and prompt engineering for both TTS and music.

## Setup

Video generation uses the same Google AI API key as image generation. If `/create-image setup` has been run, no additional setup is needed. VEO requires a **paid API tier** (no free tier).

Check status: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../create-image/scripts/validate_setup.py`
Check FFmpeg: `which ffmpeg` (required for extend/stitch/trim)
