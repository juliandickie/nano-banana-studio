# Social Media Video Platform Specifications (v4.1.2+)

Reference for generating platform-native videos with correct dimensions, aspect ratios, and duration bounds. Covers **37 video placements across 14 platforms** at SOP max-quality upload specs.

> **Status**: This is a **data-only reference** in v4.1.2. The `/create-video social` command that consumes this table is scheduled for **v4.2.0** and will use Kling v3 Std (default) or VEO 3.1 (backup) to generate platform-native videos. For now, this doc serves as the spec catalogue that v4.2.0's CLI will read.

> **Authoritative source**: [`dev-docs/SOP Graphic Sizes - Social Media Image and Video Specifications Guide.md`](../../../../dev-docs/SOP%20Graphic%20Sizes%20-%20Social%20Media%20Image%20and%20Video%20Specifications%20Guide.md) (January 2026 update). BlueSky specs are best-guess; Signal and ManyChat do not have native video placements.
>
> **Companion doc for images**: [`../../create-image/references/social-platforms.md`](../../create-image/references/social-platforms.md) covers the image specs for the same 16 platforms (87 image placements).

## How durations are expressed

Every video placement lists `duration_min_s` and `duration_max_s` in seconds. "0.5" means half-second minimum; "14400" means 4 hours (Facebook feed max). When a platform distinguishes *optimal* from *maximum* duration, we list the max in `duration_max_s` and note the optimal range in the comment column.

## Generation model routing (v4.2.0+)

The `/create-video social` command will dispatch by duration + aspect ratio:

| Target duration | Target aspect | Model |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 15s, most ratios | 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 | Kling v3 Std (default, $0.02/s) |
| > 15s (stitched) | Any | Kling v3 Std with `video_sequence.py` multi-shot pipeline |
| Lip-sync needed | Any | Fabric 1.0 (`/create-video lipsync` manually) |
| Explicit VEO preference | Any | VEO 3.1 via `--provider veo` |

- **ManyChat** — an orchestrator platform; videos inherit from the connected underlying platform (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp).

## Duration-based generation strategy (v4.2.0+ — how `/create-video social` will pick a model)

| Total target duration | Best single-generation model | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 15s | **Kling v3 Std** at target aspect, single shot ($0.02/s) | VEO 3.1 Lite (`--provider veo --tier lite`) at $0.05/s |
| 15s – 60s | Kling v3 Std multi-shot via `video_sequence.py` | VEO 3.1 Standard |
| > 60s | Multi-shot sequence pipeline required | — |
| Bumper (6s) / Short ad (15s) | Kling v3 Std single-shot | VEO 3.1 |

For placements that need custom voice narration (creator brand voices from `audio_pipeline.py`), pair with Fabric 1.0 lip-sync via `/create-video lipsync` after the video is generated.
