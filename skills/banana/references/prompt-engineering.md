> Aligned with Google's March 2026 "Ultimate Prompting Guide" for Gemini image generation.

## The 5-Component Prompt Formula

> Based on Google's officially validated prompt structure for Gemini image models.
> Write as natural narrative paragraphs -- NEVER as comma-separated keyword lists.

### Component 1 -- SUBJECT
Who or what is the primary focus. Be specific about physical characteristics,
material, species, age, expression. Never write just "a person" or "a product."

**Good:** "A weathered Japanese ceramicist in his 70s, deep sun-etched
wrinkles mapping decades of kiln work, calloused hands cradling a
freshly thrown tea bowl with an irregular, organic rim"

**Bad:** "old man, ceramic, bowl"

### Component 2 -- ACTION
What the subject is doing, or the primary visual state. Use strong present-
tense verbs. "floats weightlessly," "holds a glowing lantern," "sits perfectly
still." If no action, describe pose or arrangement.

**Good:** "leaning forward with intense concentration, gently smoothing
the rim with a wet thumb, a thin trail of slip running down his wrist"

**Bad:** "making pottery"

### Component 3 -- LOCATION / CONTEXT
Where the scene takes place. Include environmental details, time of day,
atmospheric conditions. "inside the cupola module of the International Space
Station," "on a rain-slicked Tokyo alley at 2am."

**Good:** "inside a traditional wood-fired anagama kiln workshop,
stacked shelves of drying pots visible in the soft background, late
afternoon light filtering through rice paper screens"

**Bad:** "workshop, afternoon"

### Component 4 -- COMPOSITION
Camera perspective, framing, and spatial relationship. "medium shot centered
against the window," "extreme low-angle looking up," "bird's-eye view from
30 meters," "tight close-up on hands."

**Good:** "intimate close-up shot from slightly below eye level,
shallow depth of field isolating the hands and bowl against the
soft bokeh of the workshop behind"

**Bad:** "close up"

### Component 5 -- STYLE (includes lighting)
The visual register, aesthetic, medium, and lighting combined. Reference real
cameras, film stock, photographers, publications, or art movements. Lighting
lives here as a sub-element, not a separate component.

**Good:** "shot on a Fujifilm X-T4 with warm color science and natural
bokeh, warm directional light from a single high window camera-left
creating gentle Rembrandt lighting on the face with deep warm shadows.
Reminiscent of Dorothea Lange's documentary portraiture"

**Bad:** "photorealistic, 8K, masterpiece" (see Banned Keywords below)

### Presentation Mode

Presentation mode has **two generation options**:

**Option A -- Complete Slide** (text rendered in the image):
Use when the model should render headline/body text directly. Nano Banana 2 excels
at text rendering (up to 25 chars per element). The output is a finished slide.

**Option B -- Background Only** (for layering in Keynote/PPT/Slides):
Use when text, logos, and UI elements will be added as separate layers in presentation
software. The output is a clean background with intentional negative space.

**Background styles:** dark premium (pure black #000000), gradient sweep (brand color to darker tone), split layout (half image / half solid), full-bleed image with dark overlay
**Layout zones:** headline zone (top 20%), content zone (middle 55%), lower margin (bottom 25% -- clean negative space for later overlays)
**Typography rendering (Complete mode only):** headline (bold sans-serif, 48-72pt equivalent), subheading (medium, 32-40pt), body (light, 24-32pt), caption (12-20pt)
**Pattern overlays:** geometric network, connected nodes and lines, circuit mesh, dot grid -- all at 30-50% opacity in silver or white
**Slide types:** title, content, quote/statement, image feature, section divider
**Format:** always 16:9 widescreen, default 4K (3840x2160) for backgrounds
**Color guidance:** high contrast pairs (white on black, black on gold), gradient transitions, accent colors sparingly
**Style refs:** Apple Keynote, TED stage visuals, premium pitch decks, conference keynotes

**CRITICAL -- Logo exclusion:** NEVER mention "logo," "logo placement," "branding mark,"
or "reserve space for logo" in any Presentation prompt. The model will generate unwanted
logo-like artifacts. Instead, describe the area as "clean negative space," "simple
uncluttered background," or "generous breathing room." Logos are composited in
presentation software after generation.

## Advanced Techniques

### Start with Intent, Refine with Specs

Nano Banana 2 is designed for conversational editing. Use a two-phase approach:

**Phase 1 -- Intent (Initial Generation)**
Start with a conceptual prompt that lets the model's thinking handle composition:
- "A futuristic sports car on a rainy Tokyo street at night"
- "A premium product shot of wireless earbuds for an e-commerce store"
- "A cozy café interior for a lifestyle blog header"

**Phase 2 -- Specs (Refinement via Edit/Chat)**
Follow up with specific technical adjustments:
- "Change the car to metallic red, add wet asphalt reflections"
- "Use a lower camera angle, add dramatic rim lighting from the left"
- "Make the wood tones warmer, add steam rising from the coffee cup"

**The PEEL Strategy for adding specs:**
| Component | What to specify | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **P**osition | Camera angle, framing, subject placement | "Low-angle shot, subject on right third" |
| **E**xpression | Emotion, mood, facial/body language | "Confident smile, relaxed posture" |
| **E**nvironment | Setting, time, weather, atmosphere | "Golden hour rooftop, city skyline behind" |
| **L**ens | Camera, focal length, depth of field | "85mm f/1.4, shallow depth of field" |

**Use reference images instead of written specs** when describing style or texture.
One reference image replaces paragraphs of description. Upload it and say
"match the lighting style of this image" or "use this color palette."

**When to front-load specs:** For photorealistic/cinema domain modes where camera
and lighting are critical, include PEEL specs in the initial prompt. For simpler
use cases, let the model interpret intent first.

### Character Consistency (Multi-turn)

Use `gemini_chat` and maintain descriptive anchors:
- First turn: Generate character with exhaustive physical description
- Following turns: Reference "the same character" + repeat 2-3 key identifiers
- Key identifiers: hair color/style, distinctive clothing, facial feature

**Multi-image reference technique** (3.1 Flash):
- Provide up to 4-5 character reference images in the conversation
- Assign distinct names to each character ("Character A: the red-haired knight")
- Model preserves features across different angles, actions, and environments
- Works best when reference images show the character from multiple angles

**Identity-locked generation pattern:**
Use a `CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS` block in prompts:
```
Create a professional portrait of the person from the reference image.

CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain EXACT facial features, skin tone, and hair from reference
- Keep their distinctive features identical across all scenes
- Position them naturally in the new environment
```

**Group photos (up to 5 people):**
- Assign positions: "Person 1 center, Persons 2-3 on left, Persons 4-5 on right"
- Specify each person's expression and pose individually
- Use medium shot (waist up) for best facial consistency
- Maximum 5 people for high-fidelity consistency

**Sequential storytelling (3-part visual story):**
- Scene 1: Establish character with full physical description
- Scene 2: Reference "the same person" + 2-3 key identifiers + new setting
- Scene 3: Same reference pattern + final setting
- Use consistent camera angle (three-quarter view) across all scenes
- Specify "EXACTLY consistent" for critical features

**YouTube thumbnails with character:**
- Maintain facial features from reference image
- Use exaggerated expressions (wide eyes, open mouth) for engagement
- Position character on left 40% of frame, facing right toward content
- Add text overlay separately: bold Impact-style font with thick stroke

### Progressive Enhancement (Multi-Turn Workflow)

For `/banana chat` sessions, build images in 4 phases:

| Phase | Focus | Example Follow-Up |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1. **Composition & Subject** | Get layout, subject, framing right | "Move the subject to the left third, zoom out slightly" |
| 2. **Lighting & Atmosphere** | Refine mood, shadows, time of day | "Shift to golden hour lighting, add warm rim light from right" |
| 3. **Details & Polish** | Add fine elements, props, textures | "Add steam from the coffee, a small plant in the background" |
| 4. **Technical Adjustments** | Color grading, contrast, final polish | "Slightly desaturate, add a subtle warm color grade" |

**Key principle:** Each phase preserves successful elements from previous phases.
This is more cost-effective and produces better results than trying to specify
everything in a single prompt.

### Multilingual & Localization

Nano Banana 2 supports text rendering in multiple languages.

**Translation within images:**
Generate the image in English first, then follow up:
```
Take the previous image and translate all text to Japanese.
Keep all visual elements, layout, colors, and composition identical.
Only change the text content. Ensure Japanese text fits naturally
within the same space constraints.
```

**Cultural adaptation:**
Provide cultural context explicitly for region-specific aesthetics:
```
Create a coffee shop poster for the Japanese market.
Use Japanese aesthetic principles: generous negative space,
natural elements, muted tones. Headline in hiragana: "朝の一杯"
in an elegant brush-style font. Format: 2:3 portrait.
```

**Tips:**
- Provide exact text strings in the target language rather than asking for translation
- Specify cultural context explicitly (e.g., "Japanese design sensibility," "Brazilian visual culture")
- For RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew), specify text direction if layout matters
- Generate and verify one language at a time for multi-language campaigns
- Native speaker review is recommended for production content

### Brand Style Guide Integration

When a loaded preset contains Brand Style Guide fields, apply them during prompt construction:

**prompt_suffix:** Append verbatim after the Style component. The most direct brand influence on every generation.

**prompt_keywords:** Weave keywords from relevant categories into the narrative naturally. Do not dump as a list -- integrate "premium" and "modern" into the Style component description.

**visual_motifs:** Add motif description to Style or Context. In Presentation mode, include as pattern overlay with specified opacity. In other modes, use as subtle background texture.

**background_styles:** In Presentation mode, select the variant matching the slide type:
- Title slides → dark-premium or gradient variant
- Content slides → variant with best readability for body text
- Quote/statement → dark background for dramatic impact
- User can override by naming a specific variant

**do_list / dont_list:** Verify the final prompt aligns with do's and avoids don'ts. These are guardrails, not prompt components.

**logo_placement:** This field records where the logo will be placed in post-production (e.g., "bottom-left, 15% of width"). Do NOT mention "logo" in the prompt. Instead, describe that area as "clean negative space" or "simple uncluttered background" so the model keeps it clear without generating logo-like artifacts. The logo is composited in Keynote/PowerPoint/Slides after image generation.

### Style Transfer Without Reference Images
Describe the target style exhaustively instead of referencing an image:
```
Render this scene in the style of a 1950s travel poster: flat areas of
color in a limited palette of teal, coral, and cream. Bold geometric
shapes with visible paper texture. Hand-lettered title text with a
mid-century modern typeface feel.
```

### Text Rendering Tips
- Quote exact text: `with the text "OPEN DAILY" in bold condensed sans-serif`
- **25 characters or less** -- this is the practical limit for reliable rendering
- **2-3 distinct phrases max** -- more text fragments degrade quality
- Describe font characteristics, not font names
- Specify placement: "centered at the top third", "along the bottom edge"
- High contrast: light text on dark, or vice versa
- **Text-first hack:** Establish the text concept conversationally first ("I need a sign that says FRESH BREAD"), then generate -- the model anchors on text mentioned early
- Expect creative font interpretations, not exact replication of described styles

### Positive Framing (No Negative Prompts)
Gemini does NOT support negative prompts. Rephrase exclusions:
- Instead of "no blur" → "sharp, in-focus, tack-sharp detail"
- Instead of "no people" → "empty, deserted, uninhabited"
- Instead of "no text" → "clean, uncluttered, text-free"
- Instead of "not dark" → "brightly lit, high-key lighting"

### Search-Grounded Generation

For images based on real-world data, Gemini can use Google Search grounding
to incorporate live information. Available on Nano Banana 2 via the
`googleSearch` tool configuration.

**Three-part formula for search-grounded prompts:**
1. `[Source/Search request]` -- What to look up
2. `[Analytical task]` -- What to analyze or extract
3. `[Visual translation]` -- How to render it as an image

**Examples:**

| Use Case | Prompt Pattern |
|----------|---------------|
| Weather visualization | "Search for the current 5-day forecast for Tokyo, then generate a modern weather infographic showing each day with temperature, conditions, and clothing suggestions" |
| Data comparison | "Search for the current top 5 programming languages by GitHub usage in 2026, analyze their relative popularity, then generate a clean infographic bar chart in a modern dark theme" |
| Historical event | "Search for the key stages of the Apollo 11 mission, then create an educational timeline infographic with illustrations for each stage" |
| Current events | "Search for today's major sports results, then create a visual scoreboard infographic in a bold, energetic style" |

**Important:** Always verify factual accuracy of generated data visualizations.
The model may approximate or hallucinate statistics -- treat search-grounded
infographics as drafts requiring human verification.

**API configuration:** Add `"tools": [{"googleSearch": {}}]` to the generation config.
On Replicate, use the `google_search: true` parameter for `google/nano-banana-2`.

## ❌ BANNED PROMPT KEYWORDS -- NEVER USE THESE

The Nano Banana model's internal system prompt explicitly penalizes these
Stable Diffusion-era terms. Using them degrades output quality.

NEVER include:
- "4k" / "8k" / "ultra HD" / "high resolution" (use the `imageSize` parameter instead)
- "masterpiece"
- "highly detailed" / "ultra detailed"
- "trending on artstation"
- "hyperrealistic" / "ultra realistic"
- "photorealistic" (describe the camera/film instead)
- "best quality"
- "award winning" (use specific publication names instead)

USE THESE INSTEAD (prestigious context anchors that actively improve composition):
- "Pulitzer Prize-winning cover photograph"
- "Vanity Fair editorial portrait"
- "National Geographic cover story"
- "WIRED magazine feature spread"
- "Architectural Digest interior"
- "Magnum Photos documentary"

## ⚠️ NEGATIVE PROMPTS -- No API parameter exists

Nano Banana models have NO dedicated negative prompt parameter. Do not pass
negative instructions as a separate API argument -- it will be ignored.

Correct approach: semantic reframing. Express what you want, not what you
don't want.

❌ WRONG: "no cars, no people, no clutter in the background"
✅ RIGHT: "an empty, deserted street, completely still, no signs of activity"

❌ WRONG: "no watermarks, no text"
✅ RIGHT: (add to prompt) "NEVER include any text, labels, or watermarks"

For critical constraints, ALL CAPS emphasis improves adherence:
- "MUST contain exactly three figures"
- "NEVER include any visible horizon line"
- "ONLY show the product, nothing else in frame"

## Prompt Length Guide

| Use case | Target length | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quick draft / concept | 20–60 words (1–2 sentences) | Good for ideation |
| Standard generation | 100–200 words (3–5 sentences) | Production default |
| Complex professional | 200–300 words | Full 5-component treatment |
| Maximum specification | Up to 2,600 tokens | JSON/Markdown structured format supported |

Nano Banana 2 accepts up to 131,072 input tokens. Do not artificially truncate
a prompt to hit a word count target -- quality and specificity matter more.

## Text Rendering in Images

Nano Banana 2 has excellent text rendering. Rules:
1. Enclose desired text in quotation marks in the prompt: "LAUNCH DAY"
2. Specify font characteristics explicitly: "bold white sans-serif," "Century Gothic"
3. Specify placement: "centered at the bottom third," "upper left corner"
4. For complex layouts, describe text placement before requesting the image

Example: Place the text "Happy Birthday, Sarah" in a warm gold serif font
centered in the lower third of the image.

Known limitation: Small text (<16px equivalent) and complex multilingual text
may require iterative refinement.

## Prompt Adaptation Rules

When adapting prompts from the claude-prompts database (Midjourney/DALL-E/etc.)
to Gemini's natural language format:

| Source Syntax | Gemini Equivalent |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `--ar 16:9` | Call `set_aspect_ratio("16:9")` separately |
| `--v 6`, `--style raw` | Remove -- Gemini has no version/style flags |
| `--chaos 50` | Describe variety: "unexpected, surreal composition" |
| `--no trees` | Positive framing: "open clearing with no vegetation" |
| `(word:1.5)` weight | Descriptive emphasis: "prominently featuring [word]" |
| `8K, masterpiece, ultra-detailed` | Remove ALL of these -- they are banned. Use prestigious context anchors instead (see Banned Keywords section) |
| Comma-separated tags | Expand into descriptive narrative paragraphs |
| `shot on Hasselblad` | Keep -- camera specs work well in Gemini |

## Common Prompt Mistakes

1. **Keyword stuffing** -- stacking generic quality terms ("8K, masterpiece, best quality, ultra-realistic") actively degrades output. Use prestigious context anchors instead (see Banned Keywords section)
2. **Tag lists** -- Gemini wants prose, not "red car, sunset, mountain, cinematic"
3. **Missing lighting** -- The single biggest quality differentiator
4. **No composition direction** -- Results in generic centered framing
5. **Vague style** -- "make it look cool" vs specific art direction
6. **Ignoring aspect ratio** -- Always set before generating
7. **Overlong prompts** -- Diminishing returns past ~200 words; be precise, not verbose
8. **Text longer than ~25 characters** -- Rendering degrades rapidly past this limit
9. **Burying key details at the end** -- In long prompts, details placed last may be deprioritized; put critical specifics (exact text, key constraints) in the first third of the prompt
10. **Not iterating with follow-up prompts** -- Use `gemini_chat` for progressive refinement instead of trying to get everything right in one generation
11. **Contradictory instructions** -- "minimalist design with lots of intricate details" confuses the model. Pick one direction or specify a focal point: "minimalist design with one carefully chosen intricate detail as the focal point"
12. **Impossible physics** -- "two different shadows in opposite directions from a single light source." Describe physically plausible lighting setups
13. **Inconsistent style mixing** -- "photorealistic watercolor painting" is contradictory. Choose one: "photorealistic portrait" OR "watercolor painting portrait"
14. **Aspect ratio mismatch** -- Requesting "tall vertical portrait" but setting 16:9 landscape ratio. Always align the ratio to the composition described in the prompt
15. **Negative framing** -- "a beach scene with no people, no clouds, no rocks" -- the model has no negative prompts. Instead: "an empty, pristine beach with just white sand, calm turquoise water, and clear blue sky"

restaurant, golden hour lighting, champagne in hand, luxurious aspirational
lifestyle. Captured with Sony A7R IV, 85mm f/1.4 lens, shallow depth of
field, warm color grading.
```

### Product / Commercial Photography

**Pattern:** `[Product with brand/detail] + [dynamic elements] + [surface/setting] + "commercial photography for advertising campaign" + [lighting] + [prestigious publication reference]`

**Example (Beverage):**
```
Gatorade bottle with condensation dripping down the sides, surrounded by
lightning bolts and a burst of vibrant blue and orange light rays. The
Gatorade logo is prominently displayed on the bottle, with splashes of
water frozen in mid-air. Commercial food photography for an advertising
campaign, vibrant complementary colors. Bon Appetit magazine cover aesthetic.
```

**Example (Food):**

bun, placed on a white surface with the In and Out logo subtly glowing in
the background. Falling french fries and golden light, warm scene.
Commercial food photography for an advertising campaign, vibrant
complementary colors. Shot in the style of a Bon Appetit feature spread.
```

### Fashion / Editorial

**Pattern:** `[Subject with ethnicity/age/features] + [outfit with texture/brand/cut] + [location] + [pose/action] + [camera + lens] + [lighting quality]`

**Example (Street Style):**
```
A 24-year-old female AI influencer posing confidently in an urban cityscape
during golden hour. Flawless sun-kissed skin, long wavy brown hair, deep
green eyes. Wearing a chic streetwear outfit -- oversized beige blazer,

eye, dramatic studio lighting from above.
```

### SaaS / Tech Marketing

**Pattern:** `[UI mockup or abstract visual] + "on [dark/light] background" + [specific colors with hex] + [typography description] + "clean, premium SaaS aesthetic" + [glassmorphism/gradient/glow effects]`

**Example (Dashboard Hero):**
```
A floating glassmorphism UI card on a deep charcoal background showing a
content analytics dashboard with a rising line graph in teal (#14B8A6),
bar charts in coral (#F97316), and a circular progress indicator at 94%.
Subtle grid lines, frosted glass effect with 20% opacity, teal glow
bleeding from the card edges. Clean premium SaaS aesthetic, no text
smaller than headline size.
```

**Example (Feature Highlight):**
```
An isometric 3D illustration of interconnected data nodes on a dark navy
background. Each node is a glowing teal sphere connected by thin luminous
lines, forming a constellation pattern. One central node pulses brighter
with radiating rings. Modern tech illustration style with subtle depth
of field, volumetric lighting from below.
```

**Example (Comparison/Before-After):**
```
Split-screen image: left side shows a cluttered, dim workspace with
scattered papers, red error indicators, and a frustrated expression
conveyed through a cracked coffee mug and tangled cables. Right side
shows a clean, organized dashboard interface glowing in teal and white
on a dark background, with smooth flowing lines and checkmarks. A sharp
vertical dividing line separates chaos from clarity.
```

### Logo / Branding

**Pattern:** `[Product/bottle/item] + "with [brand element] prominently displayed" + [dynamic visual elements] + "commercial photography" + [lighting style] + [prestigious publication reference]`

**Example:**
```
A sleek matte black bottle with a minimal white logo mark centered on the
label, surrounded by swirling gradient ribbons of teal and coral light.
The bottle sits on a reflective dark surface, sharp studio rim lighting
separating it from the background. Product photography for luxury
branding, dramatic contrast. Wallpaper* magazine design editorial.
```

### Presentation / Slide

Two generation patterns depending on whether text is rendered in the image or added later.

#### Option A -- Complete Slide (text rendered by the model)

**Pattern:** `[Background style] + [visual motif at opacity] + [rendered text with font description] + [color palette] + "16:9 widescreen presentation slide" + [mood/brand]`

**Example (Complete Title Slide):**
```
A premium presentation title slide on a pure black background. The text
"DIGITAL INNOVATION" is rendered in bold white condensed sans-serif at
the top third, with the subtitle "Transforming the Future" in a lighter
weight gold (#FFC000) font below it. A subtle geometric network pattern
of connected silver nodes and thin lines at 30% opacity decorates the
lower-right corner. Clean negative space throughout. 16:9 widescreen,
4K resolution. Premium tech keynote aesthetic.
```

**Example (Complete Content Slide):**
```
A presentation slide with rich gold (#FFC000) gradient background fading
to dark amber at the bottom. The headline "KEY FINDINGS" is rendered in
bold black sans-serif in the upper-left. Below it, three bullet points
in black regular-weight text: "94% accuracy rate", "3x faster workflow",
"50% cost reduction". A faint dot grid pattern at 20% opacity overlays
the gradient. 16:9 widescreen format. Modern corporate keynote style.
```

#### Option B -- Background Only (for layering in presentation software)

**Pattern:** `[Background style] + [visual motif at opacity] + [describe negative space where text will go] + [color palette] + "16:9 widescreen slide background, NO text, NO logos, NO labels" + [mood/brand]`

**CRITICAL:** Explicitly state "NO text, NO logos, NO labels, NO watermarks" in Background
mode. Without this, the model may generate decorative text or logo-like shapes. Never
mention logos even to say "leave space for" -- describe the area as clean background instead.

**Example (Background-Only Dark Title):**

### Key Tactics That Make Prompts Work

1. **Name real cameras** -- "Sony A7R IV", "Canon EOS R5", "iPhone 16 Pro Max" anchor realism
2. **Specify exact lens** -- "85mm f/1.4" gives the model precise depth-of-field information
3. **Use age + ethnicity + features** -- "24yo with olive skin, hazel eyes" beats "a person"
4. **Name brands for styling** -- "Lululemon mat", "Tom Ford suit" triggers specific visual associations
5. **Include micro-details** -- "sweat droplets on collarbones", "baby hairs stuck to neck"
6. **Add platform context** -- "Instagram aesthetic", "commercial photography for advertising"
7. **Describe textures** -- "crinkle-textured", "metallic silver", "frosted glass"
8. **Use action verbs** -- "mid-run", "posing confidently", "captured mid-stride"
9. **Use prestigious context anchors** -- "Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph," "Vanity Fair editorial," "National Geographic cover" actively improve quality. NEVER use "ultra-realistic," "8K," "masterpiece" -- these are banned (see Banned Keywords)
10. **For products, say "prominently displayed"** -- ensures the product/logo isn't hidden

### Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **"A dark-themed Instagram ad showing..."** -- too meta, describes the concept not the image
- **"A sleek SaaS dashboard visualization..."** -- abstract, no visual anchors
- **"Modern, clean, professional..."** -- vague adjectives that mean nothing to the model
- **"A bold call to action with..."** -- describes marketing intent, not visual content
- **Describing what the viewer should feel** -- instead, describe what creates that feeling

## Safety Filter Rephrase Strategies

Gemini's safety filters (Layer 2: server-side output filter) cannot be disabled.
When a prompt is blocked, the only path forward is rephrasing.

### Common Trigger Categories

| Category | Triggers on | Rephrase approach |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Violence/weapons | Combat, blood, injuries, firearms | Use metaphor or aftermath: "battle-worn" → "weathered veteran" |
| Medical/gore | Surgery, wounds, anatomical detail | Abstract or clinical: "open wound" → "medical illustration" |
| Real public figures | Named celebrities, politicians | Use archetypes: "Elon Musk" → "a tech entrepreneur in a minimalist office" |
| Children + risk | Minors in any ambiguous context | Add safety context: specify educational, family, or playful framing |
| NSFW/suggestive | Revealing clothing, intimate poses | Use artistic framing: "fashion editorial, fully clothed, editorial pose" |

### Rephrase Patterns

1. **Abstraction** -- Replace specific dangerous elements with abstract concepts
2. **Artistic framing** -- Frame content as art, editorial, or documentary
3. **Metaphor** -- Use symbolic language instead of literal descriptions
4. **Positive emphasis** -- Describe what IS present, not what's dangerous
5. **Context shift** -- Move from threatening to educational/professional context

### Example Rephrases

| Blocked prompt | Successful rephrase |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "a soldier in combat firing a rifle" | "a determined soldier standing guard at dawn, rifle slung over shoulder, morning mist over the outpost" |
| "a scary horror monster" | "a fantastical creature from a dark fairy tale, intricate organic textures, bioluminescent accents, concept art style" |
| "dog in a fight" | "a friendly golden retriever playing energetically in a sunny park, action shot, joyful expression" |
| "medical surgery scene" | "a clean modern operating room viewed from the observation gallery, soft blue surgical lights, professional documentary style" |
| "celebrity portrait of [name]" | "a distinguished middle-aged man in a tailored navy suit, warm studio lighting, editorial portrait style" |

### Key Principle

Layer 2 (output filter) analyzes the generated image, not just the prompt.
Even well-phrased prompts can be blocked if the model's interpretation triggers
the output filter. When this happens, try shifting the visual concept further
from the trigger rather than just changing words.
