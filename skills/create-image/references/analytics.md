python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analytics.py report --format html --output ~/analytics.html

# Get raw data as JSON
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/analytics.py data --days 30

# Export as JSON file

```

## Dashboard Sections

| Section | Chart Type | Data Source |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Summary Cards | Text | costs.json totals |
| Cost Timeline | Bar chart | costs.json daily entries |
| Model Breakdown | Donut chart | costs.json + history entries |

## Data Sources

The dashboard aggregates from three existing data files (no new logging needed):
- `~/.banana/costs.json` — created by cost_tracker.py
- `~/.banana/history/*.json` — created by history.py
- `~/.banana/ab_preferences.json` — created by abtester.py

## Time Range

Default: last 30 days. Adjust with `--days N`. The dashboard shows data within the specified period only.

## Output

The HTML dashboard is self-contained — no external JavaScript or CSS dependencies. Opens in any browser. Can be printed to PDF.
